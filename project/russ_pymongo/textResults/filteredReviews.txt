Hello friends,

Its more so 2 Stars (Ok). Me and mine stopped by here for a quick lunch. Pretty nice layout. This was our first time here and really didn't know what to do. Finally we found out that its nothing complex at all. Read the menu and chose from it. Easy! 

The Tai Lettuce wrap thingy-majig Appetizer. ($5.99)

I ordered the Spicy Cajun Pasta ($6.99) with add Chicken (4oz for $2.49). My wife ordered Shrimp Scampi ($11.39) with extra Shrimp add on ($2.79). 

I found my food to be (2 Stars Meh, I've experienced better). Pasta cooked pretty well... Aldente. Nice sauce. The chicken was 1-2 stars in that it really had no flavor. It could have been tofu. The Stand out was actually the BREAD. GOOD googaly moogaly. I could (and maybe should) have just ordered the bread alone. 

Wifey really didn't enjoy her food as much as I wish I did and not as much as I did the bread. She said it was bland. Needed salt etc. so that helped me because that only means More food (unfortunately not the bread) for me and Grumbles. 

I would come back to try something else out... Maybe. With a tab of $30.00+ (food & drink) I most likely will go somewhere else. Or just come back for the bread. Did I happens to mention the bread was the highlight.

Well as you may or may not know, I am always in search of the perfect Cuban sandwich. This place is it. While cursing down Tropicana Ave. in Vegas, I said look Cuban! We U turned and went in a well worn strip of shops and entered a new world. So clean, nice, well setup, linen, the works! and the waitress was very friendly and optimally attentive. The chicken soup with the squeeze of lime was oh so tasty. The Empanada was hot and fresh and flaky crusted and had a wonderful filling. The Cuban Sandwich was Swiss cheesy  wonderful and the pork was perfection (are you getting the idea I liked this place?). 
Go and enjoy, I know I will be coming back! 
Oh Yes, and the prices are so low! Impressed me big time. Great value and flavor and service. That is what we all want!

Went here on a Sunday to watch NFL football with a group of 7.  We had a friend get there early to reserve some seats for us.  Even though he got there 3 hours before the 10am game time, all of the stadium style seating had already been reserved!  NOTE:  GET THERE EARLY or you will most likely be standing.  Luckily he was able to grab an outdoor section for us.  There are about 8 outdoor sections - each with their own TV (you can pick which game to watch) and a bunch of couches.  Only bad thing is there is only one audio feed to the outside sections, meaning whatever game is being played on the big screen inside (stadium seating section) is what will be played outside. Overall a very fun atmosphere - it was VERY busy.  
The food was mediocre.  I tried the wings, a chicken avocado wrap, nachos, and onion rings.  Typical bar food.  In my opinion - I think Emeril forgot the BAM factor here.  The service was SUPER slow but understandably so since it was absolutely packed.  Here's a tip, if you bet on the games, you get complimentary drink tickets.  We didn't pay for one drink there - guess it's their way of saying thank you for losing all of your money in the Sportsbook. lol.  

However bad the food/service was, the atmosphere made up for it.  Overall a fun experience.

We came here for lunch and let me just say the margaritas are sweet nectar of the gods - wowowowooww!!!!!!  We came here after a long night of drinking and the Pomegranate Acai Margarita and the Classic Margarita with Patron were sooooo smooth, my hangover went away!  The food was great, I got some carne asada tacos which I really enjoyed.  Bartenders were so nice and friendly.

I couldn't be happier that I found this gem in my neighborhood. I am always "thinking" about projects I need fixed or repaired and this shop really does it all. I had a dad diaper bag that I wanted to embellish with some patches without interfering with the aesthetic look and functionality of the bag. I was able to make my son's diaper bag reflect his alma mater and it will be a hit. Markel went over the details with me and when I arrived for pick up, he remembered me and the bag was ready. It was beautifully sewn and I couldn't be happier. I will be back with more projects!

What can you say about a place that has been serving steaks since 1958? It's an old school steakhouse (or at least what I would expect an old school steakhouse to be like as I am not quite that old). Don't let the exterior or the interior scare you off. The food is fantastic!  We started with a shrimp cocktail--the cocktail sauce has a TON of horseradish, the server warned us. Shrimp were large and good. Followed by a salad-they served each of us with a plate of lettuce and then serve the table a plate of various veggies so you can make your own salad. Pretty cool, light and refreshing. They claim to make the dressings in house. Basic offerings for the dressing---ranch, italian, 1000 island, etc. I ordered the NY strip while the others at my table ordered the filet and a NY strip. My steak was cooked as ordered a nc served with a loaded baked potato. The others at the table were pleased with what they ordered. Dessert was the only thing lacking. Definitely not made in house and not very good. I had the cheesecake with blueberry topping. Definitely a place to check out if you haven't been.

I've been wanting to check this spot out, but it took me forever to get there. Finally my sis and her husband wanted some food, so off to The Vig Uptown we went.

Prior to heading over there, I checked my trusty Yelp, and liked what I saw. I read that it was in some random former bank, but it was not until we arrived at The Vig, did I realize that it was the bank my Dad used to take me as a kid. Waves of positive nostalgia washed over me, this place used to send balloons to kids in cars at the drive thru, and they had a huge Kachina doll there. Weird how memories take you back.

Anyway, arriving Sunday night at around 7, the sign informed us to seat ourselves, and we found a great booth near the bar. I was curious to see how they would notice new people arrived, and out of no where, a friendly server showed up. Drinks were ordered, and we took in the venue. As others have described, The Vig Uptown, is remarkably cozy, warm, and urban.I have to confess I love when reuse happens to old buildings. Rather than bulldoze a bank, turn it into a restaurant. Well done, Vig.

Drinks arrived, and they were super tasty. My sis doesn't drink (don't judge, every family has a black sheep) but our great server, Michelle, recommended a great drink that didn't contain booze, which my sis loved.

The food was amazing, and we even ordered dessert, which was unreal. A brownie sundae sounds simple, and it is, but the execution was outstanding. It was sooo tasty, I highly recommend it.

My only recommendation would be that they provide a non-valet parking option. I don't know of other places where there isn't an option to park elsewhere, or on your own. Maybe if I had an impressive car, I would be all about it, but I drive an Xterra, which isn't exactly flush, although I pretend it is a Cayanne.  A boy can dream.

Overall, this place is really, really well done. The service, food, and venue are just so well executed, I truly can't wait for the next chance to go there.

Holy shitake- this place is amazing!

This is the best cheeseburger I have ever had. I have been to all the usual suspects, including places that are fancy and expensive and purport to have the best burger. Johnny's is just perfect. 

I had the double cheeseburger, fries, and strawberry shake. What impressed me the most, is that the attention to detail on all the items. Each ingredient is top-quality and all of the parts combined come together in perfect harmony. 


I ordered:

-Strawberry shake= perfection
-Crinkle cut fries= perfection
-Double cheeseburger= second to none

I really cannot say enough about the food. Just amazing. My meal was $13, which you might think is a little high- until you taste the quality and flavor. It's well worth every penny. They have a Yelp check-in deal for 20% off, but I skipped it- I want this small business to survive and don't want to take from them. 

The place is immaculately clean, the staff were super friendly. It's just perfect. I've heard the rave reviews and they were right! 

My only request is that they offer Malts in addition to shakes. It would be super simple to just buy some malt powder and charge .75  for it. 

If you are a burger enthusiast- run, do not walk to Johnny's! You're taste buds will thank you- and you will have a new bar in which to measure all burgers.

You know when you are eating something so delicious, that as you start to come to the end of finishing the dish you get sad?  That is how I felt about every dish I had at this restaurant.  The service was great and location convenient, even for me who lives outside of Madison.  Very expensive though, so be prepared to shell out some money, but well worth it for a special occasion.

Let's start with the positives, because there are many!  From the salads to the pasta, the food here is gratifying.  I have yet to have a dish that I have not enjoyed.  Like many restaurants in Madison they brew their own beer, but here the prices seem much more affordable.  The only downside to this eatery is that it is attached to a mall.  If that is something that bothers you, then it may not be the place to eat on a first date.  But if you're looking for a place to have lunch or a quiet night for dinner, then check this place out.

I went ATVing this weekend with Ada G's husband (she was going to come too but chickened out because she thought we'd go too fast - we did).  We met them way out in North Scottsdale and I got an automatic (something bigger and bulkier with 4WD) and Jan got a 400 (I can't drive a "stick shift" motorcycle, only a car).  We got a brief lesson then the guy led us down the path and we took off.  God that's fun!  For two hours straight we went as fast as those things would take us.  It was my first time so I wasn't sure if I could keep up with him (he's done it before and rides a motorcycle) but I managed to.  Finally after two hours we were so worn out we decided to call it a day (they give you three hours).  My hands were so sore from hanging on I had to ride slower on the way back because I didn't think I could hold myself on if I flew up again on the big bumps.  Jan and the owner told me I did great for my first time and I have a natural talent.  Go figure.  Some people have the gift of music.  Some are wonderful with children, some have amazing minds and have the potential to cure disease.  My special talent is riding an ATV.  I must have some redneck in my blood somewhere.

They would have earned five stars had they not tried to repeatedly get out of their promotion.  They advertised on facebook 'rent one get one half off'.  First they tried to tell me that promotion was over so I copied it and emailed it to them then they said since it wasn't clear (it had an expiration date in the future) they would honor it (reluctantly) then when it was decided we wanted an unguided tour rather than a guided tour or to pick up the ATVs and a trailer (all included in the promotion), not only did the price go up, but the promotion didn't apply.   Why would an unguided tour cost more than a guided tour?  This makes no sense to me.  Anyway, despite this I will definitely go again.  I didn't hurt myself (shockingly), only some narrow misses so it was a great success.  Now if you'll excuse me, time for some more Advil.  Muscles I didn't even know I had hurt.

Gas and so much more.

QuikTrip is always a great choice when it comes to refueling.  I find it a challenge to just purchase "gas" when I visit a QuikTrip.  I like the soda fountain station, and the  multitude of snacks QuikTrip has to offer. I always manage to find a snack I hadn't had in quite some time, and it just calls my name.

 Reasonably priced gas, ice cold drinks, and snacks, it doesn't  get any better.

Not Bad.....Not Bad At All

I was expecting Mi Pueblo Mexican Food to be the typical Mexican fast food. Boy was I wrong.  Mi Pueblo is a step above the rest.

Lets start with the complimentary hot chips and salsa. Many Mex style recipes give you those cheap paper thin tasteless chips but not Mi Pueblo. These chips are lighy, crispy, and flavorful and  salsas are really tasty.

On this visit I ordered the grilled chicken taco plate and I  not  disappointed. The chicken was moist, seasoned, and loaded with flavor. The chicken tacos came with a homemade "dressing" not sure what it was. All I know it was really good.

Even though I was completely full from.my meal I couldn't leave without trying dessert.  So I decided to try the  sopapillas which come drizzled with honey and powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, it was delicious.

Good food, inexpensive meals, and great customer.  I will be back.

Good Comfort Food

I don't frequent Boston Market often but when I do the food is always good. Your greeted the moment you walk in the door.  

 The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and even came to check on us during our meal - like we were eating at a full-service restaurant.

The chicken and meatloaf were  juicy and delicious and the mashed potatoes reminded me of the kind we make at home.

 Awesome comfort food!!

Just kind of average .... no surprises 

In the land of ubiquitous sit down chains, Chilis could be considred one of the leaders if not the king. On my visit to Chilis I ordered the queso dip and chicken dippers and my friend ordered the half rack of ribs with dry rub and a side order of barbecue sauce. My chicken dippers were somewhat greasy and the queso dip just didn't taste right .  My friends ribs were tasty but not a lot of meat on them. The waitress replaced the chicken dippers and gave me the spinach dip instead of the queso, and it was good.

 The meal was definitely disappointing. The best part of the meal was the service, which was quick and friendly.

I have to admit I have always enjoyed shopping at Best Buy.  The prices are competitive, and the employees are knowledgeable.  The sales associates offer their assistance,  and offer suggestions without being intrusive.

Recently my health insurance changed and I had to find a new opthamologist, lucky for me I checked Nationwide Vision Center.

The staff at Nationwide Vision Center are helpful, professional, and very accommodating. The staff is  familiar with all the various Insurance companies and can answer any questions you have.

I was taken in for my exam on time and given a very thorough examination of my eyes.  Dr Burr answered every question I had. 

After my eye examination I selected my frames and lenses.  Nationwide Vision Center has a decent selection of frames, not as many as my last vision provider,however,  still a good selection. 

I am glad I chose Nationwide Vision Center.  If you ever need a vision exam, visit Nationwide you won't be disappointed.

Second to none, and the sales force is knowledgeable and informative.

The crew at Discount Tires is second to none. It was about 3:45, Saturday afternoon when I noticed, what I thought was a small leak in one of my tires. I brought my vehicle to Discount Tire to have the tire looked at before it went flat. 

Once I arrived at Discount Tires I noticed the place was packed and closed at 5:00 pm. I asked the sales associate if there was any possibility to have a tire checked for a leak, and he said, "absolutely". The sales associate took my information and advised that I was due for a tire rotation so they would take care of that as well. 

My tire was just low on air pressure, no leak, the tires were rotated, and I was back on the road by 4:30, at no charge. 

Discount Tire has consistently performed at a level seldom seen these days. The sales force is knowledgeable and can make solid suggestions if you give them sufficient information as to your needs. I am so glad I went to and will continue to go to Discount Tires.

Won't go back again.

It been over a year since I visited Macayo's.  I use to go to Macayo's often but stopped when the service and quality of food started to decline.  However, today, I thought I would give Macayo's another chance. 

The quality of food and service is worse then I remembered.  Macayo's has competitive pricing for a typical Mexican restaurant in the area, however, the food just isn't good and the service borders on teribble.

So, lets start with the service. The service at this Macayo's location  has always been ridiculously slow.  Today, I anticipated slow service due to large crowds on Valentines Day.  What I did not expect was having to wait 20 minutes for a refill on soda, then having a to ask a bus person for a refill, and once I received the refill finding something floating on top, and waiting another 10 minutes for a drink. I waited once again over 10 minutes, for a to go box, and another 20 minutes after our server took my credit card for payment.   

Let's move onto the food.  The entrees themselves are not good.  It seems that I have always had an issue with one thing or another on my past few visits.  Today, we had a cheese crisp, which was served on a stale tortilla with very little cheese.  In fact the cheese peeled off from the tortilla.  My nephew had the kids taco plate, which he did not like.  He mentioned the meat tasted "funny". I tried one of tacos and agreed the taco meat was greasy and tasteless. I had the tamale bites with Baja Sauce and although the tamale bites were good the Baja sauce tasted old and had a thick "skim" layer on top that I discarded. Once again our server was no where to be found. 

All in all a horrible dining experience.  We were at Macayo's for over an hour forty minutes because we waited for chips, waited for drink, waited for bill, waited for to go containers, waited for server to return my credit card.

A little taste of New York in Sun City

Being a native New Yorker, I am always on a quest for Italian bakeries in Arizona.  However, authentic Italian Bakeries are not so easy to find in Arizona. So when I came across New York West Pastry and Bake Shop I knew I hit the lottery. I found my little taste of New York in Sun City, Arizona.

New York West has all the typical Italian pastries, Linzer tarts, napoleon,rainbow cookies, pignoli, pie pockets, devil dogs, salt sticks, and one of my favorites sfogliatelle.  

In addition to absolutely delicious pastries New York West is also a full service bakery. I mean, they carry rolls, breads, bagels, and even pizza dough.   The breads and rolls are flaky, buttery and perfectly delicious. New York West has it all.

The customer service is second to none at New York West. It is rare to walk into a bakery that you haven't been to for some time and the owner not only remembers you but recalls your favorite pastry's, now that's what I call great customer service. All the staff at New York West are friendly, accommodating, and patient.  After all,  it can take a while to decide exactly what you want to eat. 

If your ever in the area and want delicious pastry's, stop by New York West you won't be disappointed.

A Consistent Favorite

Mimi's Cafe is one of those chain restaurans that is different enough and consistently good enough to recommend to family and friends.  All of the Mimi's Cafe Restaurants  are all exactly the same so you're immediately familair with the restruantat concept and their menu selections.   

Mimi's Cafe serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and offer low calorie meals and a limited bar selection .  The prices are very reasonable with a two dinner meal including appetizer and dessert for $25.  The serving size are very generous.  In fact there was so much food we had to take two boxes to go.  

The food is very fresh and plentiful.  The service is fast and pleasant with refills on drinks before we had to ask.  I would recommend Mimi's for a nice causal place to grab a bite to eat.

Like the name implies, La Cocina Economica  is an economical place to eat.   They offer Authentic Mexican food at decent prices.   The food is good and I have never had a bad experience.  The food is made fresh to order, so you may have to wait for 10 minutes for your order.  La Cocina offers several daily specials for $4.99.

Hit or Miss

Sometimes you have a craving for a certain food but you really don't want to take the time and trouble to get dressed up or sit in a restaurant so that's when you go for take out. 

Tonight I had a craving for Chinese, and  I wanted someplace close.  So Panda Express it was. As I waited in line I noticed that many of the selections were in short supply and two of the advertised "specials" were completely empty.  I assumed that the cook was in the process of refilling the empty trays. However, I was wrong.

When it was my turn, I was advised that it would be several minutes before new entrees would be ready, so I was limited to what was on hand.  To be honest I  did not find the food to be very tasty, certainly not even good fast food Chinese. 

So this is my conclusion of Panda Express.  No, the quality and taste is not that of P.F. Chang but you could do worse in a pinch.  I satisfied my craving for Chiense while watching my favorite television shows. Sometimes, it's all about choices

Bertha's is the Best!


Bertha's is a locally owned breakfast lunch spot and without question, Bertha's is a gem.  The food is always fresh, delicious, service is quick, and the staff always has a smile. 

If you have a chance to stop by Bertha's  don't be discouraged by the strip mall location, because  Bertha's makes up for their location with excellent food. There is a nice sitting area outside weather permitting and plenty of seating inside.  

Bertha's baked goods are fantastic. You even get a small chocolate cookie if you order a sandwich. I have to say Bertha's cookies are fantastic. You won't find better cookies anywhere this side of your mother's kitchen. I had the club sandwich/fruit salad and it was delicious, the sandwich was loaded with turkey, ham, cheese, and all the fixins. The fruit salad was good, but Bertha's puts lemon juice on their apples and I think I'd prefer my apples just like they are.

If you get a chance stop by Bertha's doesn't disappoint

Downtown Hipsters 

I spend quite a bit of time in the downtown Phoenix area and have passed by the Side Bar many times in my travels.  I had always been curious about this little downtown establishment but never stopped by to check it out.  However, that was all about to change.

Recently, I had out of town guests who wanted to visit the downtown area and I thought the Side Bar might be a good place to relax, and have some fun, I was absolutely correct.

The Side Bar has a relaxed hip vibe with their hardwood floors, brick walls, and plush seating.  Displayed on the walls are works by local artists, and old silent movies playing on the big screen.

The Side Bar has a extensive selection of different types of beers, wines and hand-crafted cocktails. The Side Bar even squeezes its own fresh juices daily. All I have to say is, fresh squeezed juice makes for amazing tasting drinks.

We had a fantastic time at the Side Bar and meet very diverse and interesting groups of people sitting at the bar and the clientele gets more interesting as the night goes on. 

SideBar is the perfect place to stop for a drink, relax, and chat with friends. If you haven't been to the Side Bar stop by, you won't be disappointed.

Wine and more is truly second to none, when shopping  for wine and spirts.  I planned  on making a quick trip however,  I stayed much longer then I anticipated. 

My favorite place for wine 

Total Wine and More carries wines from every wine-producing region in the world and from every price range. It is easy to lose track of time as you walk down  the aisles admiring the selection .  In addition to wines I enjoy looking at the selection of beers that range from America's most popular to hard-to-find microbrews and imports. 

It can be challenging at times to make a decision on what to purchase.   However, the staff at Total Wine and More are pleasant, accommodating, and very knowledgeable.  The staff will even offer suggestions, or direct you to your preferences. 

If you haven't been to Total Wine and More, you should stop by.

Disappointing  

Today, I was craving a chicken and rice bowl and deicded to go to Yoshi's. The facility is fairly clean and the staff is  friendly, accomdating, and the prices are very  reasonable. 

For under seven dollars, I was able to purchase , a soft drink, eggroll, and teriyaki chicken  bowl. The order took  less then 5 minutes to prepare. Now, in all fairness While I shouldn't expect much for seven dollars, I was dissapointed nonetheless, as the teriyaki chicken was dry, the sauce was sugary, and the white rice was overcooked and lumpy.

Overall, it was worth the price and fills the stomach, however I won't be going back any time soon.

Wing Stop. by far has some of the best wings in the state. 

If you're a fan of wings, then you need to go to Wing Stop and pick up a dozen or maybe even two dozen right this second. My sister and I go to wing stop often and we have never had a bad expeirence.

The wings at Wing Stop are 100% all white meat, served to order piping hot.  The wings are crispy, moist, and of descent size. The Hawaiian, and Garlic Parmesan were delicious and happen to be my two of my favorites. The Hawaiian styles wing have just the right amount of tangy sweetness and parmesan cheese adds just the right finishing touch. 

What I like best about Wing Stop is that  you are allowed to Mix and match your orders. You can combine regular wings and boneless wings together. Usually, I order a combination of both.  However, bone in traditional is my favorite. I could have ate a few dozen by myself but decided I probably should share.

Everytime I go to Wing Stop I order the homestyle fries which are cut fresh daily. The fries are crispy and golden brown and very tasty.  My sister isnt a fan of fries but enjoys the homemade potato salad, and fresh baked rolls. The rolls are fresh, hot, buttery, and absolutely delicious. 

The prices are reasonable and the food is great. If you decided to eat at Wing Stop arrive early because there is limited seating. 

The staff at Wing Stop are friendly and helpful. So stop by and give them a try.

Breakfast Club

On more then one occasions  I have driven by TJ's Homestyle Restaurant and asked myself, why are all these people waiting around for some hole-in-the-wall restaurant, could the food be that good?  Well, today I decided to find out for myself.

Don't expect anything fancy at TJ's. This is a down home, comfort food type of restaurant. In fact, TJ'S Homestyle comfort food is so popular that you'll most likely have to wait for a table, but it's well worth the wait.

The menu has many options from pancakes, omelets, biscuits & gravy, pastries, breakfast sandwiches and everything in between. It was so hard to choose.  Today, I tried the French Toast Combo. Two huge pieces of French Toast, 2 eggs, and 2 slices of bacon. The  French toast is made with homemade French Bread and it's delicious.  This French Toast is thick, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and oh so satisfying. You will be filled with just one slice but it is so good you will eat two.

 TJ's Homestyle Restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch so don't make dinner plans. However,  if you want a great Breakfast, at a great price, and value great customer service then make this hole-in-the-wall part of your breakfast club.

The Chipotle of Pizza 

I went to Pieology for dinner last night with my sister and nephew and I have to admit we really enjoyed our meals.  Pieology has the same concept which is similar to Chipotle.  You create your very own pizza masterpiece.

Pieology, has an assembly line concept for Pizza or salad if you  prefer.  You walk up to the counter and walk down the line.  As you walk down the line you tell the Pizza cooks what to add to your pizza.  The price remains the same reguardless of what or how many topping  you add to your pizza.

I ordered a pie with tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, roasted peppers, pepperoni and spicy sausage.  My sister and nephew  ordered similar but with a couple of topping changes. 

The line moved very quickly so we built or pizza creations, paid, and filled our drinks.  The pizzas came about seven minutes after that.  Pieology offers a good selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and vegetables.  Prices are modest, I had a standard 11 inch pie and a fountain drink for about ten dollars.

The staff is friendly, accomadating, 
the food is good, and at a reasonable price. 

If your in the area give it a try.

Here's what happened to my husband and I.

I reserved my rental car through the Southwest Airlines webpage. I figured since it was through Southwest, it had to be a good deal and good customer service. Boy was I wrong!

Hubby and I got off the shuttle bus and walked up to the counter and were greeted by "Sergio".
He was friendly at first, but then it went sour quickly.

This guy stalled us for over a half an hour with some stupid sales pitch crap, THEN he tried to talk us into all sorts of "extras". During most of this time he is on the phone with someone discussing the car we're supposed to rent VS. what they actually have on the premises to rent. Finally, he hands me my bill/invoice and tries to get me to initial each and every added extra charge. I did not realize they were extra charges until after I initialed and then took a look at the actual total that was on the invoice that they were going to charge me. The final total came up to $248.96, plus they also tried to tack on an extra $250 "insurance coverage fee."

I pulled up my original invoice for $116.11 that I had already paid online via credit card and he bickered with me and said "Oh that is just an estimate. You have to pay this now instead. That estimate did not include our extra charges and fees." On my invoice, though, it clearly stated that it did. I pointed this out to him on the actual invoice and he just shrugged his shoulders at me and said "Well that's how it is and that is what we're charging you." One of these charges was an extra $40.00 for "spouse driver". When I asked him to take off this charge and to just let my husband be the sole driver, he said "We can't do that. You already paid for this reservation in your name with your credit card, so YOU have to be the primary driver with your husband as the secondary. And that is $40.00 extra."

I got VERY upset and told them that what they are doing is total crap, very unprofessional and unfair, and to shove it. There was no way in hell I was going to rent a car from them after that fiasco! Sergio just shrugged again, tore up my old invoice, and handed me a new invoice with bright yellow highlights circled around all the zeros on my invoice to show that zero charges were made. After this, he turned away and would not look me in the eye. Neither would any of the other reps. I felt like I had just been slapped in the face.

In the meantime, my husband (who was also very upset but did not get to witness the silent treatment) ran off to find us another rental car. I caught up with my husband and I told him what he missed after he ran off. He said he came over to Enterprise and it was WAY better than what we had just experienced at Payless. The guy and girl that helped us at Enterprise were such sweeties. They heard me grumbling and also heard from my husband what happened and said, "Don't worry, we'll take care of you. This happens ALL of the time with Payless, then people come over here with the same exact complaints." Our helper Nicholas took down some information, and within five minutes, Enterprise had us a NICER car without all those extra charges for $179.00, total, INCLUDING all taxes, fees, etc...AND they did NOT charge me extra for a second driver! Ten minutes later we were on the road.

I wish I would have read the online reviews that other people posted about Payless before I reserved a rental car from them because if I had, I would have NEVER even considered renting a car from them. If my review saves even one person from going through the anguish that I just went through, then I will be glad.

After eating casino food for 4 days, my hubby and I we're looking for a healthy lunch option while on our way out of town. We checked online reviews and decided to try this place after the original place we were going to eat at was closed for the weekend. Boy are we glad we did!! We walked in and were promptly greeted by the owners. I was not sure what to get so the lady owner recommended a chicken dish. I said "Ok, sounds good!" and waited patiently as she cooked all of it from scratch. About 20 minutes later it was done and she brought it to me. It looked delicious but when I took my first bite, all I could think was WOW!! This food is absolutely scrumptious! All of it! I think I licked my plate clean! The chicken was marinated and cooked perfect. I loved the rice, the salad, the salad dressing, and the tortilla type things. I especially like the white sauce stuff that she said is made out of olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic. I would by it by the jar if I could! On my next trip back to Vegas I will definitely be coming back to eat here. It's worth the drive no matter where you are in town.

Loved the Olive Oil Fries! Didn't Love The Dirty Tables.

I decided to try Smash Burger after a friends recommendation. I LOVED the olive oil fries, and the veggies with the ranch sauce. The burger was pretty good, too, but my bun got squishy and soggy way too fast. I did like the fact that we could eat outside. The guy taking my order was a total sweetheart. The girl that brought the food was also very nice. They seem to be a bit understaffed, though, as there were a LOT of dirty tables inside and outside of the establishment and the trash cans were filled to the max. Hopefully they can get better staffed to keep the place clean.

Located in The new shopping district of Summerlin...Public School 702 makes it's home in Downtown Summerlin. A very modern and hip restaurant at that, themed after school/education like atmosphere. Everything from their menus to decorations sets the place off right. This huge place located on the second floor also has an outdoor balcony area that almost rivals the inside seating of course depending on weather. This casual yet up beat restaurant provides quick and friendly service by their staff who are also dressed casual. Not quite sure, we came on a weekend and noticed a weekend menu...so there might be a separate weekday one as well. They also have happy hour which they call recess which plays to the theme. Menu choices were kinda small but quality and choices were there. It is a bar and grill brewery type of restaurant so expect the usual burgers and custom beers and alcohol. Choices of even Lamb and Bison burgers which were tender, juicy and mouthwatering delicious. Still Public School 702 is family and kid friendly & very refreshing. As casual as it is, it still gives you that classy feeling with fun elegance. Prices are average and maybe slightly a little more for casual dining...but service and ambience make up for it as well as the food. Definitely recommend this place, at least to try out once or twice if you are in the area or after a long day shopping in Downtown Summerlin.

Located in The new shopping district of Summerlin...Public School 702 makes it's home in Downtown Summerlin. A very modern and hip restaurant at that, themed after school/education like atmosphere. Everything from their menus to decorations sets the place off right. This huge place located on the second floor also has an outdoor balcony area that almost rivals the inside seating of course depending on weather. This casual yet up beat restaurant provides quick and friendly service by their staff who are also dressed casual. Not quite sure, we came on a weekend and noticed a weekend menu...so there might be a separate weekday one as well. They also have happy hour which they call recess which plays to the theme. Menu choices were kinda small but quality and choices were there. It is a bar and grill brewery type of restaurant so expect the usual burgers and custom beers and alcohol. Choices of even Lamb and Bison burgers which were tender, juicy and mouthwatering delicious. Still Public School 702 is family and kid friendly & very refreshing. As casual as it is, it still gives you that classy feeling with fun elegance. Prices are average and maybe slightly a little more for casual dining...but service and ambience make up for it as well as the food. Definitely recommend this place, at least to try out once or twice if you are in the area or after a long day shopping in Downtown Summerlin.

I agree with the first reviewer that the appearance of this place may turn some people away, but that is all the better for you because you will get a table faster.  If you go on the weekends prepare to wait 20-40 minutes, but it is indeed worth it.

The food is very good and the service is hit or miss but what impressed me most is the wide selection of Vegetarian dishes.  I am not vegetarian but some of my friends are and sometimes I just feel like eating something lighter.  They have a great selection of grilled veggie filled burritos.  You can also get sides of grilled veggies like asparagus, zucchini and carrots.  Be sure to try the grilled carrots.

The parking sucks,  the servers are sometimes not nice and the place sort of looks like something in a bad dream featuring Antonio Banderas and a mariachi band,  but the food will keep you coming back.

This was the first Firefly that I visited and I loved it the first time and I continue to love it to this day! The location on Paradise is great because its close to the strip so if you have visitors in town you should take them off the strip and to this great restaurant! I love sitting out on the patio on summer nights if seats are available. This is my favorite place in Las Vegas to go out to dinner too. I love that it isn't a chain and is one of a kind. Even though their sangria is very popular the mojito is where its at. My favorite mojito is mango although their passion fruit and blueberry are in close second and third. I love that all of their plates are small portions. I love going with a group of friends or family and choosing many plates. That way you can sample much of their menu without getting too full. My favorite chilled tapa on the menu has to be the apple manchango salad. If you haven't tried it yet it is a must! Their petite filet is also a must try! If you are vacationing in Vegas or just a local this is a restaurant you will have to try!

I went here back in June for restaurant week. This place is excellent to visit during restaurant week because of the great deal they offer.

You may think that Circus Circus doesn't have anything to offer but you are wrong. The steakhouse has an old time Vegas feel and is probably the best thing that the casino has to offer and the reason it stays open.

Our service was great! And she was from Buffalo as well which is always cool to talk to people from the same hometown. 

For $50 you were able to get French Onion soup or salad, Filet Oscar and your choice of dessert. Considering the filet is normally over $50 this is an amazing price.

I decided to go for the french onion soup over the salad. Even though it was summer and very hot out I can never refuse french onion soup. It was very tasty and filling.

The filet oscar was awesome. For those who don't know oscar style is filet with crab meat on the top along with a sauce. This came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes were so good. I had leftovers that I made sure to eat the next day! I didn't finish my meal mainly because I had to leave room for dessert

For dessert I went with the chocolate cake. It was a big toss up between that and the chocolate covered strawberries but the cake won. It was so good! It was a large piece so I was able to take some of that home too.

The only downfall was that everything was served too close together. I like when things are brought out with a bit of a wait in between so you are able to digest before your next course comes around. The soup and main course came so close together that by the end I felt so full I almost opted for dessert to go. 

I was so glad I was able to enjoy this during restaurant week. Great food for a great deal. For those who go at anyother time of the month it's a great steakhouse but with being a great steakhouse comes cost. It's probably average price for a steakhouse but more than I normally spend on a meal.

i reviewed Rhodes Ranch instead because I noticed that this place didn't have any reviews but here it is again anyways just in case.
My friend's family has a vacation home here and we got to go to their recreation center on Saturday afternoon. It wasn't as crowded even for a 4th of July weekend. You can bring up to 4 people into the recreation center for only $5 per person per day. Not bad. The recreation center has a pool and water slides. It's like your own mini water park there. Lots of tables, chairs and shade area. Really big pool. I was very impressed. They also have indoor basketball courts, badminton, Tennis courts, weight room, Pool Hall and workout rooms. It was really nice. Also the area is beautiful. Very green and well kept. 

For pictures of the water park, here it is:

Part music venue, part bar and just an amazing place to hangout. 
Before and after every Crescent Bar show (the same amazing owner), this is where you'll find me (and I imagine many others).
Just epic. Epic I say!

Full Disclosure: I've known the owner for a couple of decades now (just from going to the shows that he's been putting on over these many years). You seriously couldn't meet a nicer, more humble guy in music production. His success is the result of being an honest and trustworthy music promoter, something rarely found in his industry.

If you want a seriously meaty tasting (and salty) burger, give this place a try. It'll fill your meat/burger craving. Got the double smoke shack and it hit the spot. Fries with cheese ....oh so good! Nice crunch and they don't salt it. 

The just ok side...hot dogs. I really wonder how Hot dog can be amazing though.

Sometimes China A Go Go gets a bad reputation for being dirty.  I've never found that to be the case at this location or even the one on North Rainbow.  I've been eating here for years and I have come to expect consistently good food and service.  It is not uncommon for me to go into China A Go Go, place a to go order and be offered a complimentary beverage while I wait.  It never takes terribly long either. 10 or 15 minutes max.  I am always pleased with the amount of food I get.  I am sure to never go hungry when eating here.  My usual order(s) are mushu chicken, orange chicken, garlilc chicken, beef with brocoli or mongolian beef.  Sometimes I'll get a noodle dish like chicken chow fun or Singapore curry noodles.  Everything I ever get is always good.  From time to time I do get egg foo young.  This was never my favorite Chinese dish growing up as I do not care for eggs 9 times out of 10.  But here is different.  I love the egg foo young and its the gravy that makes it.  That stuff would make an old show taste good.  Not that the egg foo young tastes like an old shoe.  Its good on its own but stellar with the gravy.  I just want to make that clear.  The point is I've never had a bad experience here.  I've got my dad hooked on it and my grandparents really liked it too when I treated them to dinner after they drove me home from SoCal when Grey Hound over booked their bus and I could not get on.  Argh!  But that is another story in and of itself.  Lets bring the focus back to China A Go Go.  Its good Chinese food made by Chinese people unlike some other "Chinese" restaurants *cough* Panda Express *cough*

Despite being a part of UNLV for over ten years, tonight was my first time visiting the UNLV Performing Arts Center. More specifically the Judy Bayley theatre. I went to see A Christmas Carol starring Armin Shimerman as Ebenezer Scrooge. I know him from Star Trek and Buffy The Vampire Slayer. I am a fan of both shows which is what drew me here tonight. 

I arrived too early tonight and sat outside for 30 minutes before the doors opened. Once inside, I was greeted by the very friendly and informative staff. They pointed out the bar, the merchandise table and the information table. They even mentioned that there would be a meet and greet after the show. More on that in a moment.

I walked around the lobby and sat for a while more before seating began. There were architectural plans for the set on display. Also, character and costume drawings. There was even a section for people to put on and get photographs of. This was all interesting and a great way to feel connected to the production. What piqued my interest the most was the collection of photographs which had nothing to do with the show. But there was a photo of David Hockney, an artist I am a fan of. There was even a photo of Andy Warhol. Cool stuff.

I made my way to my seat about 10 or 15 minutes before show time. It was enough time to get familiar with the set and the theatre as a whole. This is a nive small venue. More intimate and accessible than larger places like the Smith Center. I had a great seat in the fourth row dead center. I was practically at stage level. For sure one of the best seats in the house. Though I get the impression, based on size alone, there is not a bad seat to be found.

After nearly an hour of on stage action, there was a breif intermission followed by another 45 minutes of play time. It was a great production. Funny. Touching. Intense. A little bit frighening. I loved it. And the standing ovation at the end tells me that everbody else did too. 

With bows and the curtain call complete, the cast raced their way to the lobby ready to greet adoring fans like me. The cast were all gracious but we all wanted Armin. People were asking for autographs. A group of Trekkers, myself included, wanted a picture. He asked that we wait for the line to die down. We did wait and got our picture. A great way to end a fun evening.

In preparation for a Vegas list I am putting together for future reference, I am back tracking on this review from a few years ago when I saw U2 and spent a few days in Vegas. Never stayed at the hotel, however, love browsing and spending time here 'cause my kid at heart is at play. I haven't done much time in NY, therefore, cannot comment if this properly emulates the feel of the city, however, for what it is I had fun. If you're one of those people whom can't stand children, I would stay away from this hotel. There is a fun arcade in the hotel. I have yet to do the roller coaster. The souvenirs are cheesy "I love New York" souvenirs, however, more in it or the laugh than actual retail therapy. Not a lot of interaction with the staff personally but they looked all happy serving people at the front desk.

I am a sucker for themed hotels, however, in addition to come to the hotel to look at the detail, I like the Forum shops. It's the closet thing to the mall that you will get on the strip, at inflated prices. Personally other than FAO I've never actually bought anything, just browsed. It is a good way to kill time, look at expensive stores and admire the decor inside the mall. For the most part, the store are no different than the ones we have in Vancouver. I enjoy the feeling that you're outside instead of in a mall (faux cloud roof). It is actually a big mall worth checking out, just not strip shops.

Sometimes you need the basics for cheap and this is where this falls into place. Every time I do Denny's I just need a good cheap breakfast, the simple things. Compared to the other buffets and stuff it isn't the greatest but it works with my needs. I don't drink, therefore, this is great for people watching and observing all the idiots with their hang overs clinging to their coffees for dear life.

LOVE LOVE LOVEE The Family Birthing Suites at Scottsdale Osborn.  I checked in at 3 pm on June 10th - separate building from hospital.  After talking with the DR on call, we decided that the best course of action, for me and my son, was for me to have a c-section.  

Baby C was born at 6:01pm.  8lb 10oz, 21inches long, Healthy, and Screaming!  LOL
This birthing center is nice and private.  At most, there's 12 mamas on the floor.  Makes for lots of personal attention and you don't feel like just another number.  

I will say that 95% of the staff was wonderful.  The 5% being the night shift staff I had my 2nd night.  TERRIBLE!  The Aid was pretty much nonexistent.  And well the RN on her first hour on shift, she's trying to "Help" my son nurse.  She's not only man-handling my boobs, but shoving my sons face into my tit.  Baby C is screaming and I'm getting frustrated.  Then the nurse starts in with her agenda - her formula pushing agenda.  My husband was ready to cave, but I told her to give us (my son and I) 5 minutes.  She left the room.  I was able to get Baby C calmed down and latched on.  Without shoving my boob into his face/mouth.  But that didn't stop her belittling my efforts.  All night long, I was beaten down with her formula pushing as Baby C was waking up every 2 or so hours to nurse.   I ignored her every time and said each time, "well his pediatrician (who had saw Baby C and I that first day) said that my body knows what to do, and I'm producing colostrum...which is all he needs right now.  My milk will come in in a few days.  And that I need to nurse to get my milk to come in."  This horrid nurse would always say, "he's hungry..that's why he's crying.  You should really give him formula."   

Nurse Ratchet came in at 6am making her final rounds, and again I was nursing Baby C.  She finally says to me, "Well you're getting a lot of practice."  I seriously wanted to bitch slap this C You Next Tuesday.  After having little to no sleep, I lost it and started weeping.  She asked if I was alright and I said YUP.  She knew I had hit my breaking point and left.  I then began to sob uncontrollably.  I called my mom, who could bairly understand me over the sobs.  I called J, who also couldn't understand me.  But both made it a point to hurry up and get down to the Birthing Center.  Thankfully, the wonderful team I had my first day was back on shift.  The Aid came and said, as she walked in the door, "How's my superstar (I according to them had been an ideal patient...moving around the room, tending to baby, and walking the hall every few hours with Baby C...letting him get some sun from the skylights in the halls.  Apparently they have to practically drag other new moms out of bed.) this morning?!"  Then when she saw the emotional state I was in, "OMG are you alright?  What's wrong!?"  I cried on her shoulder for a good 20 minutes.  She reassured me and she said she would notify the nursing supervisor of what happened.  Baby C's pediatrician was making rounds and stopped by while the Aid was getting my vitals.  I addressed what happened over night, and said that if that nurse and aid was going to be back on shift, that I wanted to get Baby C and I discharged (if all my dr's approved).  Dr G. was outraged at what happened!!  She's pro-breastfeeding.  So Dr. G went and paid a visit to the nursing supervisor.  I was happy to hear that Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick was going to be returning that evening.  

My RN that day was Ruth.  OMG.  RUTH = AWESOME  She's been an RN for at least 50 years and her bedside manner proved it.  She's wonderful.  She knew I had a rough night and wanted Baby C and I to get a nice nap.  So she let me nurse C and came in a few minutes after we finished up, with a bottle of lotion.  Baby C was already asleep.  I'm tellin you, I got the best backrub of my life that morning.  And J said I was out like a light within minutes.  
 
So there you have it.  From one end of the spectrum to the other.  Ruth vs. Nurse Ratchet.  

The facility = 5 stars
The staff = depends on who you get.  
Nurse Ratchet and her sidekick Aid = Negative Stars
The rest of the staff = 5+ Stars!

I'm going to go ahead and give 5 stars.

I love this Walgreens.  I love that it's right down the street from my work.

I love that I can get not only my meds but also make digital photo prints while waiting for those meds.  Love the fact that I can go in at 2pm or 2am and find what I need - Gotta love 24hr locations!!

Shoot even if I did need something at 2am, I'd still drive to this location rather than the 24hr location off Thomas and 36th Street.  Without even thinking twice about the distance.

I tried fire pie for the first time this past Saturday at the Northsite location. I immediately was dumbfounded at the fact that nobody had thought of this concept up until recently. So now I have been to fire pie twice, with this location being visited today for lunch. Yes I enjoyed it that much that I went and had fire by again but two days later. Lol

Fresh ingredients, your pie or salad custom made right in front of your face, and seriously fast service / cooking time. Both times I have the steak and blue, crispy, and easy on the oil and garlic.  

Yup, I have found a new lunch time spot to add to the rotation! :)

Fresh ingredients, your pie or salad custom made right in front of your face, and seriously fast service / cooking time. Both times I have the steak and blue, crispy, and easy on the oil and garlic.  

Yup, I have found a new lunch time spot to add to the rotation! :)

This places makes me feel happy because of all of the art and bright colors. To top it off, the vibe is very cool and it's a great place to relax. The menu has lots of great multi-ethnic inspired foods and the best homemade cupcakes that you will ever have in your life! I ordered the Chorizo, Avocado, and Cheese Omelet with a mimosa. The chorizo was homemade and probably the best chorizo that I've had this far. It had lots of flavor, tasted fresh, and matched well with the omelet. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the mimosa had the perfect balance since it wasn't too acidic. And the cupcakes...... I tried the vanilla bean and the chocolate and they were delicious! I will definitely be back!

I'm from SF but came here for work and wanted to see one of my favorite band here at Mr. Smells theater. Cool place, cool bands but hooooollllyyyy crap the girls collecting tickets and the front desk were such rude little brats! I want to use a few other choice words but it's yelp and its public. But anyways.. The front door girls were typical hipsters with piercing and tats and horrible Midwest fashion, like plaid and a lot of black and black dyed hair, you know, like every other hipster. They were rude and unprofessional and had this horrible resting bitch face and were eating Chinese food. Seriously you couldn't do that before work or when you got of? You really want to welcome people with a steamy hot plate of garlic??? Gross. Anyways I had trouble getting a hold of my ticket and they were extremely unsympathetic. They held such a stern "so what" attitude. Not very helpful or kind. So I went outside, saw a security, guard slipped him a $20, and he slapped on a pink wrist band and opened the side door for me! Boom im in and got to see my favorite band circa survive. Thanks for the memories Mr. Smalls! Can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh! 

Ps. The venue is small, intimate, and pretty great and has excellent beer selections!

A+ .. Great great craft cocktails and great bites! Came with co workers and sat outside on a Friday afternoon. We had a few drinks and they were all amazing. I honestly have no idea what was in them but they were all great! 
We had a very nice friendly server who gave us great prompt service. She had good recommendations and was very helpful. 
We ordered a the pork belly on kimchi and if you like pork I would say def gotta try this! I usually don't like kimchi but I thought it was actually really good. We also got the Brussels sprouts and everybody loved them but I'm not a huge fan of brussel  sprouts. We also ordered the Mac a cheese and its was soooo creamy and yummy. Not too heavy and had a nice crunch on top. I didn't think Pittsburgh would have anything cool like this.. I really enjoyed this place and their new sister store next door, tako. I would come back to both!

So I'm Here in Pittsburgh for the week and decided to come downtown for a late night snack and drink with some co workers. We were going to some bourbon bar. Next door however... I see this funky dimly lit place playing notorious BIG and outside it says TAKO. Im intrigued instantly just by the music and the word Tako.. (I love tacos. For example if I was on death row and I could have one meal, it would be tacos.) so without hesitation or any permission from my co workers I just signal the "hey we're going in here first" face. Pretty packed but we manage a seat at the bar and we are just FLOORED by their tequila selection. 

So this awesome bartender, Caito, makes us all these wonderful tequila based craft cocktails that we just absolutely loved! Then we order chips with a trio of salsas and Mexican corn to start. Both amazing! 
We were so impressed and I was shocked there wasn't many yelp reviews so I asked Caito how long have they been open and she replies... "Since Tuesday" holy balls they just opened and I just happened to find it randomly?! I love random amazing finds!

SO THEN THE TAKOS. We tried just a few; The carnitas, the al pastor, chorizo, and fish. Favorite was carnitas and al pastor. Amazing flavors, well marinated meat cooked to perfection, and fresh made buttery soft tortillas. Chorizo taco was good and had a fried egg which was awesome but it was just a little overwhelming and I wasn't in the mood for breakfast. Fish taco was good could use a little more flavor but I'm also not a big fish fan. 

I'm from California and I'm part Mexican and these were some of the best tacos I've ever had and in Pittsburgh. WTF. They were a little expensive but still very tasty. Very good quality and very good flavor. They come in orders of two and the price ranges from about $10-$14. We're probably coming back tonight or tomorrow. I can't wait!

Delicious, unique, amazing hotcakes!!!! Crepe-like and thin, buttery, and exceptionally crispy edges. My first bite was to die for. They're really filling and really buttery so after awhile you feel a bit gross stuffing your face, but it's really, really, really good.

I got the "morning after breakfast" which is two eggs, a meat, and hotcakes. It was a perfect combo meal, and I ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were greasy and not as crispy as I would have liked, but the breakfast overall was really good.

Quick service, busy place, and delicious food!!!

My eyes are always bigger than my stomach so of course I ordered the larger portion which was exactly what they say, grande. So much food but so good. Go with the regular portion unless you're feeling adventurous.

I have been a Verizon customer for years, and love that every time I call or visit the store I get great service.
Having an old version iPhone, I stopped in yesterday to see if I was ready for an upgrade. Unfortunately I was several months away, however, I was on an older plan so my plan was updated, saving me $5.00 a month, which also made me eligible for an upgrade.
After selecting my new phone, Josh Story, helped upgrade my phone and transfer all my data over. There were some issues with my Contacts and Photos, but he was able to solve and by the time we were done, everything was migrated smoothly.
In addition, I decided to exchange my old iPad for a new iPad mini, again with a great offer.
I would definitely recommend stopping by, even if you may not be eligible for an upgrade, as they seem to have offers all the time.
The Manager and Josh are great assets to the Verizon Team.

This morning I was craving some tea so I decided to stop in here and treat myself, first timer. I had the peppermint hot tea and I noticed on their menu they had vegan options. I asked the gentlemen in the front and he said they are completely a vegetarian restaurant with a lot of vegan options. He also informed me of their vegan lunch options. I came back and tried the smoked tofu sandwich with nut cheese and my gosh, it was SO delicious!!! I give this restaurant 5 stars, I almost wasn't even going to stop in but I am so glad that I did!

I hate to leave anything less than 5 stars because I truly love this place but if they don't keep consistency with their food, I just won't be returning. Since I've been coming, I've always ordered one thing, my vegan sandwich, once I tried their soup which was good. The last two times I came in, my sandwich was so different. The first time, they had cherry tomatoes and not regular ones, which made it pretty messy to eat because everything kept falling out. The second time I came, today, they used plain unflavored tofu instead of smoked tofu and let me tell you, the whole sandwich taste changes. I had to add on hot sauce and salt to give it some flavor which still wasn't good. Today was the first time I didn't finish my sandwich. The last time I was here with my boyfriend, they messed up on his sandwich. I just cannot keep recommending people to come here if the food isn't consistent. I'm just disappointed because I really love this place but I drive far for vegan food, this being one of them, and it's disappointing to come and eat their amazing sandwich and then get something different. Ugh. I specifically drove for Urban Beans today from the west side, just for them, and I leave disappointed. I will give it another try before I go down the street for vegan food.

***BEWARE OF BED BUGS AT SUITES IN SIGNATURE AT MGM GRAND!!!  DO NOT RECOMMEND BOOKING THROUGH LAS VEGAS SUITES!***

I booked two luxury suites for my friend's bachelorette party.  We were more than excited as the price was reasonable and the suites included a lot of great amenities.  Everyone was more than happy with the rooms until my friend started getting hives the day after we arrived.  Since no one else in her room was immediately affected, we thought she was having an allergic reaction to something else.

After the group departed Vegas and returned home, my friend confirmed with a doctor that her and her family members contracted bed bugs.  I immediately contacted Las Vegas Suites, who also confirmed the room was positive for bed bugs.  In this type of situation, I would expect sincere apologies, great customer service, and ample compensation for damages.  However, I received none of the above.  I did not once receive an apology and I had to continue to follow-up to get in contact with someone here.

I finally spoke to the general manager, Krystle, who explained the best they could do was credit me back $100.  $100 FROM A $2,800 BILL.  Clearly, this wasn't going to cut it so they offered me a total of $200...not so awesome.  I'm still working with them and now the Signature at MGM as to what they can do to help with this situation.  I hope the management at Signature at MGM will be better than the company I booked through and look into dropping Las Vegas Suites as a property management partner altogether.

They have a lot of beer. Otherwise, it's pretty much Chilis or Applebees... with lots of beer. Yard House is a beer bar for the non-creative.

The list is impressive. They have some neat stuff and the 6 pack samplers change regularly. The food is good, but I can't tell if it's microwaved, so that's almost as bad as being microwaved.

A mix list provides cleaver names for the combos you already know and love. The servers are generally pleasant and helpful and have, at the very least, remembered the scripts for various beer questions that may arise.

It is good, not for everyone, but sometime for me.

If you are in the area to kill time, stop in, have 2 beers and see how you feel about the atmosphere and the selection.

I have only ever eaten at this location, but we have ordered from them about 10 times in the last 5 months. NEVER fails. I suggest you have 2 bottles of red wine and some great movies on hand and plan for a yummy night in.

We ordered last night and the man on the phone said that it may take about 45 minutes. He warned me of this before I ordered, and I find this respectable. I'll be damned if dude wasn't there in 42 minutes :)

Sesame and Orange Chicken are great. We get one of the 2 each time. Do the Egg Rolls, Spring Rolls are lame. The Chow Mien is perfect. You know how some places let the fat noddles stick together?? Not here, nope...

Also, they do not line the bottom of the containers with veggies, a deceptive trick many Asian delivery places pull.

Their bulk specials and family combos are excellent. Also, they include coupons with every delivery.

We will continue to order from here because they are reliable, consistent and very friendly.

This restaurant deserves all the success and lines out its door. One walks in and is instantly greeted by a giant chalkboard of food items listed divided into  to meats, salads, sandwiches, and sides. I decisively decided on their steak sandwich with filet and then a 6oz meat plate of flank (and it comes with a small side salad, toast, and tiny portion of grilled veggies). Depending on the cuts of meat prices vary. Strip steak is the cheapest to filet being the priciest. Ordered both meats to be cooked medium rare. 

While ordering you can see all the cute young chefs working hard grilling those meats in a modern clean kitchen. Sauce is unlimited and this place is byob even though they also sell beer and other soft drinks. They have wine glasses and beer glasses on the shelf along with plates and cutlery... it's self seating but someone still brings the food to you and will clean up after you. 

Oh man, the steak sandwich is good! They didnt skimp on the filet either. I knocked one star down because my flank steak was more of medium done than medium rare. Still very flavorful and not chewy. Affordable steaks here!

Brought my family here to celebrate my birthday as I wanted to do something a little different. Usually we go to True Foods for all of our family birthdays but I figured I'd give this place a try since I heard good things. We sat outside, which was a big mistake. They had a one man live band playing that was just God awful and it reached a point where we couldn't take it anymore and left. 

When my mom made the reservation that said she could bring my cake and that they'd refrigerate it for her. Well, when she brought it, they didn't put it in the fridge so my birthday cake was ruined. 

The food was decent. I had the veggie burger which was good. The bread was a little doughy but overall it had a good flavor. We also ordered guacamole, which was really good. 

They have a rather large patio with ping pong and bean bags, which looks like a lot of fun. I wanted to stay and play but it seemed like there was a long wait to play the games and the band was terrible. I don't think I can listen to the Beatles anymore after the guy butchered Let It Be.

I'm willing to give this place another try even though they pretty much ruined my birthday. I felt bad for my mom because she worked so hard baking my cake.

When my mom made the reservation that said she could bring my cake and that they'd refrigerate it for her. Well, when she brought it, they didn't put it in the fridge so my birthday cake was ruined. 

The food was decent. I had the veggie burger which was good. The bread was a little doughy but overall it had a good flavor. We also ordered guacamole, which was really good. 

They have a rather large patio with ping pong and bean bags, which looks like a lot of fun. I wanted to stay and play but it seemed like there was a long wait to play the games and the band was terrible. I don't think I can listen to the Beatles anymore after the guy butchered Let It Be.

I'm willing to give this place another try even though they pretty much ruined my birthday. I felt bad for my mom because she worked so hard baking my cake.

Been here hundred times. Yes. I am not exaggerating. I wonder why I haven't write review until now. 

This is the first place I will consider when I need Chinese food. It's very traditional cozy environment like my home town restaurant. The food is great and staff are very friendly. Even the boss behind the glass window making the dumpling are always smiling. It's not a fancy restaurant, but the foods is really authentic and awesome. 

Just to keep in mind that they are very popular and busy, so be prepare to wait if you are coming on Friday noon, or over the weekend. 

It's your own fault, if you have waited for a long time to be seated.

Well, I so desperately want to give this place 4 or even 5 stars.  Maybe I will eventually, but for now I have to go with two. 

We ordered through eat24 and were given a delivery time of an hour.  An hour and fifteen minutes later I called to check and was told that our food should be here "any minute". Fifteen minutes later, I called again.  It came a few minutes later -- ice cold and kind of ruined.  The crepe was wet and cold from steaming in the box, condensing and then raining back down on the cooling crepe.  The French dip was just cold, still edible.  We microwaved it and revived it somewhat.  It was pretty good except that it came with a tiny cup of au jous that wasn't sufficient for even half of the sandwich, let alone a sandwich that had been microwaved and toughened up a little.  But it was still very good.

The spinach salad was a bit of a shock considering there wasn't a single leaf of spinach in it.  It was nothing but arugula with some tomatoes and walnuts (no Gorgonzola as listed either). However, it was fresh and the dressing was good.  

The price was decent.  And I have to say that when I called a few times trying to track down my dinner, the staff was very nice and apologetic.  They explained that they had let the driver go home early and then were slammed with 30 orders.  So I can understand that ---- happens.  The food that we received was subpar, but definitely suggested that if served hot or not rushed (maybe he didn't realize how he was screwing up the spinach salad) I think it would be pretty damn good.

We will try it again someday and perhaps update with the review I think this place could achieve.

This place was worth a second chance -- I suspected it would be.  Really great food.  The delivery was prompt the second time and the food was hot.  They treated us to a replacement for the initial screw up and we ordered the same thing.  It was perfect the second time.

6/5 stars.

Of the Cirque du Soleil/Franco Dragone shows, I've seen Mystere, Love, Zumanity, OVO, Ka, O (2x), Le Reve (2x)

My top two favorites are O and Ka. I've recommended the two to every single person visiting Las Vegas with limited time/money.. and if they planned to watch others, those two must be enjoyed last to avoid being prematurely desensitized. All Cirques are beautiful & captivating in their own way, but many of us forget how to appreciate things once we've seen/tasted/felt/heard "the best".. Think of the kind of practice and endurance it requires for all Cirque performers to do this twice a day every.single.day. 

Incroyable.

Keep your eyes, ears, and nose ready for a sensational treat.


P.S. Book early, get Orchestra Center seats, around 5-15 rows from the stage. For both O and Ka, you don't want to sit too close or you may strain your neck. And don't forget to set aside time to admire the Richard MacDonald structures before you enter the theatre!

__________________________________________

If you're blessed with the time and money to watch all of the above on your next trip to Las Vegas (or if you regularly visit), I'd say watch them in the following order (saving the best for last): 1.) Zumanity, 2.) Mystere 3.) Love, 4.) Ka, 5.) Le Reve, 6.) O - I haven't seen Elvis or Believe, so I'm not sure where they fall in line.

You know the menu looks so good.  You really want to love this place and visit it daily because there is so much on the menu.  Then you get your food and realize that it is just not good.

I had a mushroom swiss burger with a side of sweet potato fries w/pesto-mayo dipping sauce.  The bun was stale (clearly frozen) and got wicked soggy, the patty was from Costco, and the mushrooms were drenched in grease.  Ate about half of it before I gave up.  The fries really weren't bad but they were no where near as good as Fez or even Deluxe.  

I hated the interior of this place - it made me uncomfortable to sit there and watch this "chef" peel off paper from frozen patties.  This space would make a great ANYTHING ELSE but the cheapskates who run it are clearly just running a bait and switch job with the menu.

Christy and her husband Shannon, were very communicative during the process of selling me and my husband's first home! They were always networking to get our house seen, and that's what I love to see as a client. They sold our house, and we are pleased with the ease of a stressful process. This team is very easy to talk to, understanding of our goal, and professional! If you want your house sold or looking to buy, I recommend them.

Yum!! I came in here today craving polvoron and I got what I wanted! Upon arrival I was greeted and was helped with - not knowing what to get. I got the ube flan, and green tea and ube polvoron. I was lucky to even try a creme de fruita cake slice! The polvoron was made to order, so it takes 15 mins to make, and then when you go home, you let it sit in the fridge or freezer a couple hours to harden. My older sister got to experience Philippines, and says it tastes like what she remembered from Philippines. It's not like what you get from the Filipino store ( dry or powdery - but more moist like ). The ube flan was different, but in a good way, thick consistency. The creme de fruita reminds me of my childhood, family parties - but it's not so sweet, and doesn't have that weird gelatin top, but more their version. This place is cute, and even offers some Filipino food! I was eyeing their fresh rolled cheese bread, but that's for another time. They also offer drinks such as Thai tea, milk tea, smoothies, etc. I also want to try their empanadas, donuts, the list goes on. I have to say everything I tasted was great, and they offer other polvoron flavors, such as mango, coconut, etc. We will be back!

Why not 5 stars? Well, not all of the dishes are really 5 star worthy, and it's more of a 4.5 star review, but the two trips to this restaurant were rather different in feel, which leads me to a slightly lower review.

I've now been here twice, and I can safely say, the 2nd time was much much better!  First, never get the gnocchi.  The first time, one of my fellow diners got the gnocchi, and unless you like French gnocchi, you will be confused and disappointed.  The waiter this time talked one of the people I was dining out of the gnocchi, and she should forever be in his debt.

For starters, we had the cod brandade, which was excellent, their olives, which had a lovely herbal note to them, and the charcuterie platter, which was a little too much sausage, but just wonderful.

We then had salads, with the warmed goat cheese, which provided a nice sweetness to the bitterness of the salad. It had a touch of fennel in the dressing, which also brought a sweetness to the dish.  It was very well balanced for a salad.  

My dinner was the flap steak special. It had the thickness of a filet, but about double the size on the actual steak. It was tender like a filet, but juicy like a rib eye.  A fantastic cut of meat, though the swiss chard bed it sat on was rather on the salty side.

We all had desserts, most getting the chocolate mousse. I personally had the creme caramel, but the table also shared a tarte citron, which was probably the best dessert they offered up.  I highly reccommend going here, and make sure to get a good waiter. The service we had was fantastic! He was funny, light, and kept the dinner fun and relaxing.

Wow! What a change for the worse!

I really liked this place and as NT pizza snob gave it very high review the first time around. This time it was nearly inedibly salty. I mentioned this to the workers who said "Yeah, it's really salty!" I just waited for more of an explanation. Had something gone wrong that day? Had someone miscalculated a step in the recipe? Had a container of salt been spilled on my specific slice? 

Nope. "It's the sauce" they said. No apology. No concern. No offer to refund or exchange for an edible slice. As I ate the 4 bites I could handle I watched the other patrons around me. Grimaces and comments not surprisingly obvious... "Gee, this is salty." 

Not returning here. Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitain remains the Vegas Strip champ. And it's just across the street.

Yum yum...I've only tried the pizza place and grabbed breakfast here, so this probably isn't very accurate. However, it is convenient and affordable when you just want to grab a quick bite. The calzones and other pizza-looking (but not pizza) things are a bit overpriced, IMO, but the salads are what really stands out in the food court. Giant and abundant in meats and cheeses yum yum! Bonus that you can even customize your own! 

Breakfast is a bit of a hassle...lines are long since everyone wants the good breakfast deal...($4 for oatmeal, $7 for a set meal of eggs, bacon, etc) I just got the fruit cup, but they also have nice giant plates of fruit and other goodies. Coffee is your typical cup o' joe; nothing too special. I will definitely get the breakfast specials next time I come!

There is also a really nice lady at night who gets utensils, makes sure you aren't missing anything, and even grabs ice for your bottled water. Amazing service for a food court!

Bottom line...salads GOOD! breakfast specials WOW!

Following the model of Chipotle and Q'doba, Zaba's offer quick fresh Mexican food in large portions.  There is one difference that I think is key though, it's locally owned and operated.  I like knowing that, especially in Vegas where everything is big flashy and commercialized.

I've been to this location, and a few others around town many times.  The food is constantly fresh and affordable.  No matter if you get a bowl, burrito, salad or quesadilla you'll be happy with the result.  I understand it's not gourmet food, but for the price point, you're noting going to get more value and fresher food than from Zaba's.

I started with the best skinny vanilla latte I've ever had and if I wasn't so full, would have ordered another one at the end of our breakfast.

Came back to sushi samba after almost 3 years and it was just as good! We had to wait almost an hour for a table but it was understandable considering the giant CES conference was going on. The Amazonian roll for vegetarians was awesomeeeeee. Even though the place was extremely busy, our waitress was on point. 

We ordered the veg tempura this time and weren't exactly thrilled about it but weren't disappointed either. Could've done without it. Avocado roll was good and the seaweed salad came with three different types of seaweed.

Solid. The Place is super solid.  You cant go wrong with any of the food here.  The kids menu is very good,  my boys love the Mickey Mouse pancakes with apples on top.  The staff is always super friendly and helpful,  which is especially cool when you bring to small boys and a baby! The shaved prime rib sandwich is insane.  My wife always gets the same, eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce. She loves it. We all love their hot chocolate with fresh whipped cream and they give you one refill for free! Nobody does that with hot chocolate! The Place is highly recommended. Thanks for doing it right.

Solid. The Place is super solid. You cant go wrong with any of the food here. The kids menu is very good, my boys love the Mickey Mouse pancakes with apples on top. The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby! The shaved prime rib sandwich is insane. My wife always gets the same, eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce. She loves it. We all love their hot chocolate with fresh whipped cream and they give you one refill for free! Nobody does that with hot chocolate! The Place is highly recommended. Thanks for doing it right.

Wow! 5 different eggs benedict dishes? French press Italian organic Lavazza coffee!? Yes!

What a beuatiful space. Just what this area needed,  is an upscale, trendy breakfast and lunch spot!

First thing you encounter when you walk into the restaurant is the amazing circular Bloody Mary bar, with so many accompaniments to your deliciously mixed breakfast boozy drink. You can add as little or as much to your Bloody Mary as you would like. Crazy.

The benedicts are out of this world. I had the crab cake benedict, and it was amazing. It was packed with fresh crab and the hollandaise was savory with just a touch of lemon. I actually added avocado to mine, which I think completed the flavor.

Coffee is served in individual tall French presses, finished at the table. Very nice touch! The coffee they use is organic Lavazza coffee from Italy. Lavazza just happens to be my favorite,  because it has such a mild, nutty flavor with a hint of chocolate without any bitterness.

The brisket hash will have you drooling, it was so good. They smoke the brisket in house,  since they own the BBQ place next door. The flavor complimented the scrambled eggs we had, which we also added cheese to.

We can't wait to come back for lunch, they have some really good looking sandwiches on the menu we want to try.

The service was excellent, everyone was all smiles and very attentive. The owners Joey and Cristina were on hand to greet guests and make sure everyone loved their food. Their hands on approach makes a difference, they were so nice.

Overall, a definite regular spot. The food was very good, menu had plenty of choices and attentive service.

One of the nicest properties in Las Vegas, and with a price tag in the 100's of millions it had better be. They have done a great job keeping it clean and fresh, most casinos start off very nice and within a year or so they look like quite run down. What a great casino to walk around in. This place boasts a great attention to detail. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the pool is a lot of fun.  Stop in and get out of the sun for a little while. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!

Ok so this is as low budget as one can get on the Las Vegas Strip (sorry Casino Royale).  Great food deals (two Nathan's hot dogs for 3.50 I think) , cheap booze and low limit table games. Plus 24 hour Beer Pong. If you need to get away from the luxury of the Venetian, or you are feeling just a bit too clean at Wynn, stop by and slum it.

I will start with a tip. It has a great parking lot. You can access it from either Koval or Tropicana; basically what I am saying is parking on the strip with out having to drive on the strip! Now to the hotel itself, the last time I stayed here the room was great, a good size and quite clean! If go during pool season, they have a wide variety of pool areas from the raucous to the serine to the family friendly. They also have plenty of restaurants of all types from the very casual to high end.

We're so done with this place.

Years ago Gordon's was such a great place to go for lunch when there was a fun festival on Mill Ave, or for dinner when you and your friends were going out for some fun. Now Gordon's is a place full of constant disappointments.
A couple months ago we went to the Gordon's in San Tan Village and we were served cold, tasteless food. A month later we decided to give them another try and it happened again. This time I wrote to Gordon's telling them of our unsatisfactory visits, and they were very courteous and mailed us gift cards while encouraging us to give them another try.

Today we visited the Mill Ave location and regardless that the food was free because of the gift cards I wished we hadn't gone. We sat in the self seating area near the bar. Our server was very standoffish and you could tell he didn't want to be there at all. He brought us our soda's and took our order but he didn't bother to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, nor did he ask which option we wanted for our sides. While waiting for our food I noticed both of our glasses were dirty and had old food remnants in them!! I grabbed another server who was walking by and told her. She apologized and took the glasses. A few minutes later she brought our new sodas over and said, "Well we serve lemons and strawberries in our glasses from the lemonades but they were sterilized so the food pieces in them were clean so it's okay." Are you effing kidding me!? Finally the food came and just like the San Tan Village location the food was cold, and absolutely tasteless. We finished our meal gave the gift cards to the server and left. 

Seriously, if you're looking for a fabulous burger, great beer, excellent service and an a fun atmosphere please take the time and go to the San Tan Brewery which is in Chandler off of Arizona Ave and Chandler Blvd in the old town area. You won't be disappointed! As my dad would say, they could sell their burgers in India they're so good. http://www.santanbrewing.com/
However, if you're in Tempe and don't want to drive all the way to Chandler (and okay with fighting for parking) try Four Peak's Brewery, they're also fantastic.  http://www.fourpeaks.com/

We came here based on a couple of recommendations. When we walked in no one greeted us they just looked at us. The place was old and dumpy looking. Finally a lady grabbed a couple menus and just walked away without saying anything. We followed, assuming she was seating us. She slide the menus onto the table and walked away again, squeezing between us. It was extremely rude and awkward. We sat down, and gave our drink order to the asking server. Upon opening our menu we didn't see a lot of meals, more like separate items. It was odd. In addition, the prices seemed outrageous; $9 for two eggs and a couple pieces of bacon!? That's ridiculous! $8 for a couple pieces of French toast!? After seeing the crazy prices, along with the disrespectful hostess, we weren't impressed, we left. Instead we went to Mill Ave right down the street and had an amazing breakfast at the NCOUNTER.

This particular location I use the most! I can say that generally speaking whatever I need they've had it from certain things from grocery produce to miscellaneous things you need around the house. Out of the 3 locations on the south west side of town this one is often the most clean! I would rank the location off of Rainbow/215 my favorite though.

I would have to say that out of all the event centers this one would be my favorite! I love the seating arrangements and how the layouts for concerts are! If you have a floor seat they are usually extremely close to the stage! One of the worse things to do is purchase an expensive floor seat and not be as close as you'd like to the stage! That's definitely not the case at this venue! If you are looking for good reasonably priced drinks the Hop & Olive drink station is great! Especially if you don't have cash! They have a lot of booths that are cash only and this place is one of few that accepts debit/credit cards! Overall a fantastic place to come and enjoy a concert! Hotel rooms aren't too far either which make it an even bigger plus if you stay here and do an event!

Definitely can't go wrong with a visit to the oyster bar! I would have to agree that the oysters are nothing to run home and tell about but they are decent! You would think that they would have above par oysters being that the restaurant name is themed around that particular item! The infamous pan roast happened to be one of the items I ordered and it was exactly what I anticipated  it to be! VERY GOOD! Filling and rather tasteful :-) I got a medium but i think I'll do more spicy the next time! Clam chowder is a hit! I wish it would've been hotter though!

I'm not sure if I just happened to get here on a fantastic day or what but based on the previous  reviews I should consider myself LUCKY. I made it a conscious effort to make it here prior to opening because I could NOT spend all day renewing my registration and drivers license! When I pulled up at about 7:50 AM of course that line was almost wrapped around the building and I slightly panicked! Ha! No worries! They move that line so fast that when it came to putting my number into that little kiosk I received a text message saying there were only 32 people ahead of me! Wait What?! Yup! I was out of there by 8:37 AM! Less than an HOUR! As far as the customer service I must've also lucked out on that because I encountered about 5 different employees and all were very helpful and understanding. And I'm sure somebody is reading this right now saying I'm probably an employee or a family member of somebody that works here but no... I just got lucky! Sorry for those other's who weren't as lucky. But I will say that waking up extra extra early DOES matter! Get it over with you will thank yourself later that day for sure!

And often times they have sales on just about anything you can think of that is top shelf, you just have to catch them on the right day! After living in GA for a year having a liquor store that opens at 9 AM is by far a privilege!

The SKYBOX is awesome, as well as the tv screen and light visuals.  If you love electro music, this is def. one of the spots to hit up.

THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST BUFFETS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO IN LAS VEGAS! I HAVE NEVER LEFT A BUFFET UPSET & HUNGRY!

I came here for breakfast MONDAY MORNING right after the whole EDC WEEKEND. I thought to myself...HOW CAN YOU REALL F*CK UP BREAKFAST?? ITS LIKE IMPOSSIBLE! 

Anywho...this place happened to do so. The eggs are tasteless...LITERALLY TASTELESS! The sausage was OK...the bacon was decent...the biscuits were whatever, etc... EVEN THE OMELET TASTED WEIRD...and THE APPEARANCE OF THE OMELET WAS DISGUSTING. Out of my whole breakfast meal...the best thing was the unlimited servings of ORANGE JUICE...and the GRAVY.

I have never left a buffet so upset and so hungry in my life. 

On the other hand...the restaurant looked very clean and very beautiful, but the food does not speak for itself. Another thing about this place is that they have cheap food...the price for breakfast was about $7?? &
&
YES I WAS HUNGRY...I did not lose my appetite from you know what.

FINAL words? DO NOT COME HERE! if I were to come here...it would be for Champagne Brunch

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^

Located on St Laurent and Laurier is this trendy looking Thai restaurant. The place looks really fancy with waterfalls, carved doors & a gigantic Buddha statue. In the back they have a nice lounge area. The food is not authentic. If you are here for authentic Thai food, you'll be disappointed. Come with an open mind and you'll enjoy it. The ingredients are really fresh and the food is tasty.Their Tom Kha is good. Thai soup made with coconut milk. Its very rich. Also chicken with sweet and sour sauce is good. Their entrees don't come with rice. You have to order it separately.  Its a bit on the expensive side, but its a trendy lookin place so you expect it to be pricey. 
So my quest to find an Authentic Thai restaurant in Montreal continues........ Hit Me Baby One More Thai !!!

For all the years I've been staying mid-strip, my biggest complaint was a lack of a good convenience shop walking distance to the casinos.  Well, my complaints have been answered. Not just a convenience shop, but a drug store with extras.  Right next door to the Venetian and Palazzo and a short hop and skip from the Mirage and Treasure Island's is this place.  You can get cold drinks, bottled water, drugs, some grocery and even food here.  Plus it's 24/7 baby!  Of course, you pay higher than a grocery store or a pharmacy off the strip, but that is the price you pay for such a convenience.

Any coffee shop other than that overpriced overhyped Starbucks is good for me.  Located in the Palm's food court, you can get your coffee needs here.  I'm not a fan of McDonalds but love their coffee.  If it's coffee you want, then head over to McDonalds where is just as good, but much cheaper.  But if you want ice blend, cappuccino, espresso, then come over here.

Stay away from these money hungry thieves! my husband today and we have good insurance, went for a cleaning and as a new patient. Got X-rays done, they kept saying he had cavities but refused to show them to him on the x-Rays. They didn't even do the cleaning, gave him a rough total for work he will need of over $600 and we had to pay a $60 dental visit. Funny because our insurance covers visits, and fillings! I just went to an out of state office, got a cleaning, an exam, and a filling, walked out paying nothing! I will be calling my insurance about this and reporting this "dentistry" and contacting these fools about this too, I just wish we had looked at all the reviews on here where people got screwed over by these people.


Just spoke with our insurance about this practice, not much they can do after the office has wrongfully taken your money. Our insurance covers everything they said my husband had to pay and that insurance wouldn't pay for. Also they said I'm not the first person to call and report this office. Going to have records transferred elsewhere. I guess that's how the doctor affords that real nice car he has, by taking from his patients. If you are considering this place please check out others reviews and call your insurance to see if anyone else has reported this practice before they take your hard earned money.

I really wanted to enjoy this place.  First off, the place is adorable, very original n fun.. Great for kids and adults.. They have some good beer selections n the patio is fun. The food on the other hand was a major disappointment. We ordered the herb and goat cheese tots and beer cheese to start with.  Both were served cold and u can tell they were never heated properly to begin with. The tots must have been old because the cheese on top never even melted on them, and the herb stuff looked and tasted like bird doodie. The beer cheese soup must be sitting back in the kitchen at room temp because it was cold by the time i got it and so was the limp bacon hanging off of it.. The worst and scariest part was being served a cold prime rib dip and jus, after it came back reheated, it was just a soggy greasy mess. Im really sad about the whole ordeal because Michael the server was a sweetheart n totally deserves a great place to serve good craft food at. I left totally sick feeling and mad i give outlying places like this a chance. Why cant suburbia have decent food.. Back to the city i go, after i throw up...

Pros: My best friend was here for a visit from VA, where they don't have this fast food restaurant. She has actual cravings for their tacos. She loved them. I haven't eaten here in over 5 years. Ordered the sourdough jack and split it with my sister. Decent. Fast service. 

Cons: Greasy fast food. I prefer McDonald's fries.

Very similar to Todai in style.  They serve hot foods (terriyako, udon, tofu, etc) as well as a full sushi bar with rolls and nigiri.  In terms of quality, they definitely have the upper hand.  I was surprised by the freshness of the nigiri, and they don't skimp on the portions of fish at all.  They are actually quite thick and tasty.  I don't like that the rolls are very california and spicy tuna oriented.  Most look about the same; they just pile on the sauces and dressings over your standard california or spicy tuna roll.  I hardly eat rolls anyways, so this is a non-issue for me.  Their service is quick and friendly, and it hardly ever gets too crowded.  Parking is on site which is good, and I like that this place is really clean.

Fat Tuesday is the place to be if you want to get piss drunk before the sun sets.  If you want to black out, feel free to request extra shots.  The bartenders are very fun and attentive, and its actually quite a challenge to finish the 42 inch.  In terms of alcohol to cost ratio, this has got to be one of the best deals on the strip.

That is your training class for Fat Tuesdays. You are now certified as a FAT TUESDAY BARTENDER. Thank you come again.

OK --- Fat Tuesday = Not a bar.
It's where 7-11 employees graduate to. Seriously a monkey can pour an adult slurpee. This place is for amateurs.
When you first turn 21...This is a good place.

I'm not saying Luv-it is the greatest....I mean it is in a crappy neighborhood next to AM-PM and Olympic Gardens. But their custard is really pretty good. I like sundae with Marshmallow creme, hot fudge, pecans....I think it's Desert Sundae but I like to add bananas. 
They also have frozen bananas, malts - shakes etc....
Now in true Myke fashion - I shall attempt to plagerize what other yelpers have said about it!. Because after 19 reviews - I agree with a lot of it.
Luv-It has become somewhat of a secret lately, and it's kinda a fun one.  Everyone used to know Luv-It.  It's been around FOREVER.  It's where you went to get frozen treats, man.  Located by my high school, we'd stop off and grab a cone or a cup before heading back for class.  It was 1995, my shoes were chunky, and I had a cone of Luv-It.  Life was awesome!
  Found out they have been in the same old rented building since 1973, no wonder it looks like it's been there a while.  That didn't stop me from trying their famous "Western Sundae."  It was out of this world:  Hot Fudge, Hot Caramel, and Salted Pecans.  It doesn't get better than that.  Their line was at least 50 people deep waiting for this stuff.  
Hahaha it's hot right now - go to luv it's and love it!

Gisteravond na de overweldigende reviews op Yelp hier gegeten. Goed, maar geen 5*.

Lief wilde per se een Pekingeend en ik wilde absoluut niet nogmaals bij Pearl eten. Eerder een zeer teleurstellende ervaring gehad. Maar dat is voor een andere review.

Lief had zogezegd de Pekingeend, ik de beef with asperagus and black pepper. Vooraf - weer ingestonken - pot stickers en fried shrimp. Zeg maar iets met ogen en maag. Way to much. Dat moeten we echt niet meer doen.

Waarom geen 5 sterren? Eten was goed, uitstekend zelf, maar de service miste een beetje. Het was een drukke doordeweekse avond en mijn lief had eigenlijk de hele eend op tafel verwacht. Maar in plaats daarvan kwam er zonder overleg eerst de buns met het vel en pas na 10 minuten de rest van de eend. Minpuntje. We zijn weliswaar toeristen, maar willen liever niet ook zo behandeld worden.

Verder uitstekend, en zeer betaalbaar. Was aangenaam verrast. Heb voor het eerst een doggy bag gevraagd. Zojuist de potstickers opgewarmd en ook dan nog steeds heerlijk.....Als je in Vegas bent: doen. KJ's Kitchen wordt zeker toegevoegd aan onze standaard to-do-list. Naast The Omelet House (Charleston), The Naked Fish, Craftsteak en Il Fornaio.

Probably 4.5 stars, not the best breakfast spot I have ever had In this world but but hands down the best spot in vegas so it gets 5.  This place is also the same as Egg Works and I have eaten at both spots and they are both excelent. 

There menu is awesome with all the regular stuff plus with crepes, omelets, scrabbles, skillets, bennys, and hawaiian breakfasts.  They also have a cincy chili section that I like, I have never had cincy chili for real but I know what it's all about (over spaghetti) and this chili is real good.  You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.   

They do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.  They also won some awards for their cincy chili burger but I have never had it.   

My good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  Well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake.

All things considered this is my favorite BBQ place in town and in the past I went on a rampage looking for bbq in vegas and would like to think I have tried almost all.  I am not a huge fan of chains but this place serves good BBQ and it's always consistent.  What I love about the place is the BBQ platters for 2 or 4.  It's an upside down garbage can lid with chicken, ribs, pork...  I think you get to pick 3 or 4 meats, plus a couple sides and some cornbread.  Its like 25 bucks for 2 and it's plenty of food and I am a big eater.  Compared to other places it's a deal.
 

Now it's not the greatest championship bbq but it is still pretty tasty,  the meat is always tender, has a good mild smoke, and is very flavorful.  Also some places do some meats good and others not so much, all there selections are good by me.  They have like 5 sauces that are all good and the sides are solid.  I really like luciles bbq too but the combo I order for myself is 26 bucks so this place is half the price and comparable and consistent, I have had some charred up racks of ribs at luciles. 

Break down of vegas BBQ, my opinion of course

Luciles - Delicious, probably the most delicious in vegas, but pricey.  Great atmosphere, great sauce, great meat, and great sides. They serve you biscuits before that are awesome.  Have had some meals there better than others.    

TC's - OK overall, light smoke, ribs not the most tender, sides nothing special, pulled pork is good, raised the prices but still not bad

RUB - Ate it once, expensive and not memorable.  Wasn't terrible though

K's - Worst I have had in vegas, the only thing more tasteless than the meat is the sauce. 

Cooks - In the ghetto, sweet sauce, decent BBQ, bring a gun

CJs - I guess its texas BBQ, counter serviceand pricey for what you get.  Plain BBQ with thin sauce, didn't get it. 

Memphis - Good ribs, mushy pulled pork, pricey I think, good flavor.     

Adams - Had a pork sandwich, was dry and the sauce didn't help much.  That's all I remember.

I still need to try buzz, I heard it's good.

So... I came here for the Yelp Elite Event and this place is freaking awesome.  My mind was blown. 

Location: its great having some where cool to hang out that's on the south side of Charlotte. It's trendy enough to be in Noda and cool enough to be in Epicenter.  But  I'm glad that it's not.  It feels good to have something this cool in Ayrsely. 

Amenities: they have plenty of pool tables, ping pong tables, board games, arcade games, shuffleboard, foosball table, corn hole in the patio, tons of TVs, and bowling lanes.  Again...how cool is this place.  

Food: I was able to sample some of their food. The chicken and waffles was really good. The pretzels with the beer cheese was magnificent. The chicken tenders with their spicy Polynesian sauce was the perfect duo. The chicken and pimento cheese wraps and the veggie wraps was just as good. 

Beverages: we were able to try some of their vodka drinks with sweet tea.  They were sweet but strong.  A definite crowd pleaser. 

Service: its great to know that a place with great amenities can still provide excellent service.  All the waiters and waitress was tentative to our needs and they were really friendly.  I even found out that one of the waitress lives across the street from my neighborhood.  And the manager, Todd made sure that everything was perfect. He even gave a hug to my husband and I.  I'm so glad that he put everything into this establishment. It shows.  It's rare for me to give a perfect rating, but its a honest and accurate rating. 

Parking: its not the best, but its free parking and ample amount.  It's a busy area but I was able to find  parking. 

Everything was perfect here. The only thing that I didn't inquire about was security.  If people gets rowdy, I'm not sure if they have security.   But I'm sure Todd has that figured out already.  :)

So... I really wanted to like this location, but it's just not as good as the Central Ave location. For starters, the food isn't consistent each time I come.  I've had good Mac and cheese here and then I've had horrible Mac and cheese here. The staff is definitely friendly but it doesn't make up for the inconsistent food being sold here.  Also, this location doesn't have the fried Mac and cheese which the Central Ave location does. 
There are two main perks with this location.... 1. I haven't had them run out of food, like the central Ave location. 2. The place is definitely more spacious. 
All in all.... I would visit again since it's close to my job, but when it's the weekend, I would rather go all the way to Central Ave than to go to the location that's 10 minutes away from my house

Located along the walkway to the monorail at Bally's. They have a nice breakfast special that is a bunch of food for only $8.95, so if your hungry then this is the place for you. Of course they also have hot dogs too but I ate none of that.

I stopped here to get my salads to go. I loved that they were always made fresh for me. I was also able to get my croutons on the side. I hate soggy croutons on a salad. It was also only $3 bucks to add grilled chicken, which is not a bad deal. They even put that on the side per my request. I don't like wilting lettuce from hot items. I am really high maientence when it comes to my salads luckily there dressing came in tiny containers or we would have had another request.

Quality of items were good and I was happy and my heart was happy with the healthy options. There can sometimes be a line here especially around lunch time. They give out pagers so you can grab a table or just get out of the way and wait until your food is ready. The Bally's Sportsbook is over here, so you can watch a little sports while your food is being prepared but don't try to eat it there or you will get yelled at. It hasn't happened to me but I've seen others get yelled at.You have been warned!!!

This is my second trip here...amazing burgers!   The quality and the toppings are so good.  I love my business trips to Madison. 

Outside you will find an ordinary building (nothing special) with a line waiting outside...but inside it is a beautiful bar and restuarant.  If you are by yourself, then go past the line and squeeze in at the bar.  Don't ask the last guy in line outside because he never knows anything.  Those are words to live by!!!

Today I built my own burger and I was so happy...perfectly cooked medium rare...if you serve burgers you need to make sure they are not over cooked and this place does an amazing job.  

Great micro brews on tap.  Happy Hour also rocks...half off all tap beer from 4-6pm but I've never had the chance to enjoy it because I'm usually working at that time.  Makes me sad I'm paying full price right now. 

When in Madison, I highly recommend this place for some burgers and Beer.  The Onion Rings are also good too!!!

If I can give zero stars I would. This is absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life. Watching ants on the floor would have been more entertaining than him. 

1. Cross Angel has no showmanship. He is corny as hell. His jokes are just terrible. 

2. He performs 5-6 tricks within a 1.5 hour timeframe. All the tricks are repetitive. Nothing but him appearing and disappearing. It's so terrible, you can see the panels on the stage floor where he disappears. 

3. He doesn't do anything that made him famous. His TV show and his performance in Vegas is worlds apart. Makes me believe everything he's done on tv was staged by people and cgi. He doesn't levitate, he doesn't do crazy things. He makes pigeons appear, cuts people in half, and makes people disappear like any corny magician. 

4. Maestro his Mexican dwarf was the most annoying effer. You can't help but want to karate kick him to the face cause he's so corny and annoying. 

5. All he does is talk, talk and talk about himself and his accomplishments versus doing magic. 

Luxe needs to remove him quick. I want my money back ASAP.

Hands down, my FAVORITE hotel on the strip!!! I'm spoiled by this hotel and it is the only place I want to stay when I go to Vegas! I have stayed at nearly every hotel on the strip, including Wynn and Encore and I think the rooms here are the best.This hotel is beautiful, upscale, and will wow you away with all the lovely Italian decor. I'm reminded of Venice when I come here... except it's much cleaner, lol. Venetian is the original building, while Palazzo is the new building. I've stayed at rooms at both. Rooms in the Palazzo are slighty larger, about 750 square feet, compared to 700 square feet for a standard room at The Venetian. Standard rooms include a living area and THREE TV's! One TV in the "bedroom", another in the "living room" and another in the bathroom. Living rooms also include a sofa that is actually a sofa bed. What I do not like, is that the cost of a 1 king bed and 2 queen beds are different prices, about $20 difference. If you are pleasant at check in, they may give you a complimentary room upgrade :)

Anyways, I think this hotel has it all... except for the Vegas buffet!! LOL. Anyways, I always LOVE the decor here. There is a beautiful shopping area upstairs, with a gondola outside and inside the hotel. The people on the gondolas will sing... it seems very romantic, and hopefully, one day a guy will take me on it. It's kind of pricey though, about $30 a person, but you can get discounts. The stores are a mix of affordable and higher end stores, so shopping here is quite reasonable. There are also a variety places to eat from casual cheaper food court type places to high end restaurants. The only eatery missing is a buffet!

The club Tao is also found here and it is also beautiful in there. It is located on the second floor of shopping and the club is 3 stories high including a rooftop pool area, which I like the best because I like to be out in the open at clubs. In the summer, it is also a dayclub called Tao Beach. You can also eat and Asian Fusion dinner at Tao and the first floor is actually a more lounge-like atmosphere. I would say that the club here ranks after XS at Encore however, which happens to be my favorite club in Vegas. But if you are staying at the Venetian, there is a separate entry line and you can get free entry passes from the conceirge desk. 

They also have a spa here, with fitness facility that includes rock climbing. using spa facilities will be $25 if you are staying at either the Venetian or Palazzo and about $40 if you are not. 

Lots of fun events ensue here. They have Carnivale in the fall and Winter in Venice in the winter. During both events, there are special performers, singers, and special decoration. I love the Winter in Venice decoration! It is just breathtaking beautiful!! During the winter, also if you gamble and earn enough points, you are invited to attend their Grazie Gifts Extravaganza. Trust me, compared to other hotels, they go all out for this. It is literally like shopping at a store. You check in and then go to another room to "shop". Write down what items you want, go check out and they will call you when they have your stuff pulled up and ready for you. While you are waiting, there is water, hot cider, hot cocoa, tea and coffee. It was my first time this year going and I can't wait for it next year!! Other hotels, it's just a computer that you order from...

The main difference between Palazzo and Venetian is that the Palazzo has a non-smoking gambling section and that the rooms are a bit bigger. Price of the rooms are the same at either one. I suggest getting a Grazie card and using it to earn points! That's how I get my rooms comped here!! Wi-fi here is included in the room resort fee... just connect to it! Very easy!

Stay here! You won't be disappointed!! I can't wait to go back ... and I just left yesterday!!!

There is nothing special about the hotel here... and no reason to come here, but to watch Mystere. They have now officially closed down the pirate show in front of the hotel in favor of opening up some more generic drugstores and that sort along the front. I wasn't a big fan of the hotel before... but I liked the ORIGINAL pirates fighting show. I lost more interest in this hotel when they "sexified" up the show to become "Sirens of TI"... a show with a bunch of half naked girls dancing and singing... with too many sexual innuendos to be a free family show...

I have never actually stayed in the rooms here, so I cannot comment of the quality of their rooms... but my favorite hotel is Venetian/Palazzo, so my standards may be higher than others.

As far as the hotel and casino itself... it is VERY stuffy. They spray this scent in the hotel, that I guess is to help cover up the smoke smells... but is is WAY too strong and makes it hard to breath because the scent actually practically suffocates you, especially with the low ceilings. I hate walking into the hotel because of that. The hotel itself looks outdated on the inside. 

I don't know how good their players card rewards are as I only play where I'm loyal to to maximize my rewards... but I do not have enough interest in this hotel to "invest" in it. They have a tiny arcade hidden in the back... I remember as a kid coming here and it actually had a midway area... all that is gone now. 

Now that I've seen Mystere here... and that the pirate show is gone. I have no real reason to come to this hotel...

What a wonderful affordible apartment complex. The rent is quite reasonable. And you get a good amount of space for what you're paying. 

If you opted to select one of the upstairs apartments, you won't even miss out on there being no fitness room or center here because the stairs are super steep. You'll be getting your StairMaster experience every day. 

Youe bathroom has a jacuzzi jet feature, which is quite fabulous.

We were really sad to see Lao Thai go and were even sadder to read negative reviews when Pon Ocha Soup first opened.  But, boy, are we the happiest campers in the Wild Wide East now!

After reading a couple good reviews recently, we decided to try Pon Ocha Soup.  Upon arriving, the decor is almost the same as when it was previously Lao Thai.  The buffet station is still there, and the same elephant tablecloths are still there. 

The menu looks a bit smaller and different, but they were actually able to make the dishes on the menu. (Lao Thai had a bigger menu, but they always weren't able to make certain dishes.)

We had the sausages (appetizer page; I don't know the name), the pork skin with Chinese broccoli, the tom yum noodle soup and the raw shrimp salad (on the a la cart menu).  

The plate of sausages were plenty of food for the two of us.  They were actually better and juicier than before. The pork skin w/ Chinese broccoli was not salty and the pork skin was perfect.  The noodle in the noodle soup was a bit soggy, but it was still very good.  Last but not least, the raw shrimp salad!  Oh my gawd, I could not believe it when the fiance pointed it out in the menu.  Not long after we ordered, I heard the food processor in the kitchen and I knew the wonderful ladies in the kitchen were making the deliciously spicy green sauce for my raw shrimp salad.

It was the last dish to arrive, and it was everything I could hope for!  After eating my fair share of raw shrimp salad in Bangkok (Thailand, that is), I know what it is supposed to taste like, and this is no joke!  Aside from the freshness and the deliciousness of the shrimps and the sauce, they gave us at least a dozen shrimps in that one order!

The service was wonderful albeit the server who seems to have problem with hearing.  We are definitely going to come back regularly to Pon Ocha Soup and we are happy to have probably the best Thai restaurant in town so close to our home!

One last last thing is their lack of a liquor license, but that's not their fault.  The chef tells us they are waiting for its approval.  Five stars!

Formerly Enoteca San Marco, the only change is the name.  The food, service, and wine list are still incredible.  I'm happy to report we've eaten here twice since our meal in August - once in September and again just a few days ago.  Louis served us again and made a very nice wine suggestion.

On to the wonderful food...  
Think local, sustainable food prepared fresh with the focus on the individual ingredients.  If you're looking for a quickly prepared chain restaurant type of meal, this isn't it.  If you're looking for Carraba's, Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden type of Italian food then you'll be disappointed.  This is waaayyyy beyond and above that - this is for people who love and appreciate the freshest, locally grown ingredients prepared in a way that allows those ingredients to SHINE, prepared by chefs who love food.  This is a locavore's dream, slow eating, enjoying the moment.  It should be also be noted that Otto's is a Green Certified restaurant - water efficient, recycling, sustainable furnishing and food, no disposables (napkins, hand towels), energy efficient, and chemical and pollution reduction.  Way to go Otto!

Starters - Prosecco, proscuitto, lonza, and mortadella as well as three types of cheese which are accompanied by truffled honey, apricots and mascerated cherries.  We also ordered the arancine (rice balls) and a calzone - which were cooked perfectly!  Lastly we tried the broccoli appetizer and WOW!  Wish I could make that at home.

Next, the 2007 Ca' Marcanda Promis while we munched on the arugula and proscuitto pizza - thin, crispy and so incredibly fresh.  Artisanal pizza at its best!

As the season changes, so does nature's offerings from the earth to Otto.  The pasta with fresh green beans, potato and pasta was so much more than I imagined it would be.  I wouldn't have ever thought to put potato with green beans - the pesto brought it all together perfectly.

Lastly, Louis suggested the 2003 Tasca D'Almerita Rosso Del Conte to pair with the braised pork shoulder in an apple reduction with cucumbers & chiiis as well as the veal meatballs.  The pork shoulder is caramelized and sweet and fork-tender and my favorite.  The veal meatballs are the most tender meatballs I've ever had.  I don't know how they do it - we've tried it at home and they fall apart so easily.

Another incredible meal!

Another AMAZING meal at Otto!  We met Leo for the first time, and he was very pleasant.  We started (as usual) with a glass of prosecco and some meats (testa & mortadella) and cheeses (ricotta, pecorino, and gorgonzola), ordered a bottle of red italian (bastianichi), had a some fried squash blossoms filled with cheese and slightly, gently seasoned with sardines, and ricotta balls mixed with cherry peppers, green olives, and whatever else makes them taste so amazing!  We then finished with the ricotta meatballs - juicy, delicate, and oh so good!  Thought we were done?  Oh no!  Louis (loved seeing you again, Louis!) remembered that we enjoyed our amaro and generously allowed us to try Zack's own blends - what a great way to prepare for dessert!  I had no idea Zack was making his own versions, and they are very tasty - a green walnut and an almond that stand up against my favorite's.  To finish it off we had a trifecta of seasonal gelato (remember, this restaurant is all about seasonal, slow food) of nectarine, plum, and blueberries.  Went home and laid by the pool, basking in the gloriousness of a great day after a great meal, thanks to the good folks at Otto!

BTW - I was reading Bonnie's review from June and although I'm sure their party didn't enjoy their meal I am convinced there is a bit of exaggeration in her review.  The meatballs are not, nor have they ever been "marble sized", and in my experience (having eaten there many, many times) the past is cooked perfectly.  All I can think is that their party was not accustomed to eating seasonal foods a la slow food style.  I'm sorry to hear they didn't enjoy their experience.  If you enjoy the freshest, local ingredients and are prepared to enjoy your meal, I have no doubt it will be an exceptional experience!  If you're looking for a $5 slice of pepperoni pizza with generic cheese, try somewhere else.

The waterfall transports you into another world, so you enjoy the ambiance more than a usual club.

My husband and I ordered the plate for 2. Wow!! It was not only very tasty but huge! We both ate our full and took home 3 boxes of leftovers while leaving most of the salad there. 

Here's the breakdown:
Iced tea is strong! Water tastes filtered which I always appreciate 
Salad is fresh and minty. All depends on your personal taste. 
Hummus was topped with fresh parsley and cumin. The taste was very good. 
Garlic sauce was also fresh and (of course) super garlicky (not our favorite but nothing wrong with it)
Tahini - very good
Rice - Soooo good!! The raisins on top were surprisingly yummy 
Chicken Kabob- excellent 
Chicken shawarma - excellent 
Steak kabob - excellent 
Grape leaves- the only ones I've ever liked. Normally I find them to be quite nasty 
Falafel - by far the best we've ever had. Obviously fresh made while we waited. 

All in all - a surprising treat. We will be back and bring guests.

Service was good too.

Today they told a client of mine (I'm a Realtor) that their agent (me) should have told them I made an appointment for them to show up today and I should've told them. (I did not and would not). I'm such to death of lying sales people. 

I will, going forward, forewarn every client of their lying sales tactics. Do NOT trust them or use them.

They have a large selection which is nice. They didn't have as many of the animatronic items displayed as we hoped but we still enjoyed shopping and browsing. Prices are not cheap but they usually last.

Service was friendly, dining outside was pleasant. I had the green wrap to limit carbs. It was ok but nothing I'd crave. My husband had a turkey sandwich. It automatically comes toasted which he didn't realize and doesn't prefer, he also felt it was skimpy on the meat. We would probably need to come back and try again but not sure we would go out of our way to do so.

For those who say this is like Chipotles, that's not entirely accurate. The setup is but the flavor of the food is vastly different. The meats here are in a gravy, which is not our preference. They only have white rice, which we didn't try. Their chips are blue corn.  Tasty but not like Chipotles with the hint of lime. Their Queso was very good and not something that Chipotles offers. The tortillas were freshly made and quite tasty. We would probably come back to try a quesadilla and/or chips n queso, but we would not come back for the meat dishes because we didn't prefer the flavor. Service was good but nothing outstanding.

This bar had become something of a second home to me on Monday nights for the 2.5 years we lived in Madison.  During most of the week it's a nice blue collar hangout, but on Monday's it keeps the blue collar drink pricing, but adds some of the best live funk and soul music to be found in the midwest.  Also check out Wednesday nights for the open jam session they have weekly.   Best beer on tap? Moose Drool hands down.

FYI this place is closed..it's now Bluewater Grille. But looks like the exact same place pretty much..add a couple booths and take out a wall. Decided to try the 5 entree choices for $5 deal that they had going. The Sourdough bread is AMAZING!!! My friend and I tried the Fish & Chips.. It was good no doubt, and many will enjoy. But it just wasn't unique enough or amazing for me. There are too many restaurants in Az that DO fit that bill.. to return to "decent". The fish is good, it's fresh but it's just that.

Okay so a sports bar is the LAST place I expect to find mouthwatering deliciousness. But this place is undeniably a must eat. Ive been here a few times and I have never been disappointed, but what prompts me to write about it is the Acapulco Shrimp Quesadillas. They are out of this world, the spicy jalapeno creme sauce is genius! My coworker ordered the pesto pasta and it smelled heavenly. The smell is that smell that even though you're stuffed beyond belief you still want to keep eating because it smells so good smell. Does that make sense.  Other than that its a great place to people watch..off track betting spot.. need I elaborate? You will NOT be disappointed by the food in fact it will trump any bad service experience you may have.

You know when you build something up in your head and it just let's you down? Well that just didn't happen! LOVE their garlic fries. Also tried their Cajun Fish tacos and they were overstuffed deliciousness. Not at all spicy so the "cajun" in the title isn't really necessary but tasty all the same.

I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. 

The Fountain is kind of weird. It's split into two sections, sometimes has nice, fairly unobtrusive live music, and is generally pretty empty. The food is fine, but nothing special. In terms of their menu and pricing it seems like they're competing with the Old Fashioned. The problem is that their food isn't as good as the OF's and their portions, while ample, don't compare. The menu is also fairly short. They make a solid burger, fairly average sandwiches, and not much else. 

Service is always friendly, but there are some bizarre hiccups. Two people in our party of six ordered grilled cheese and it came out at least seven or eight minutes before everyone else's entree. As the waiter explained, "Grilled cheese doesn't take as long to cook." Umm, yeah, I know-- that's why you wait a few minutes to start it. 

I do have to say that these guys have hands down the best Bloody Mary in Madison. The garnish is incredible-- they gave me thick slices of cheddar cheese, summer sausage, and a friggin' barbecue shrimp. Hot damn.

When I moved to Madison I was shocked at how truly awful the downtown pizza was. Ian's, Pizza de Roma, and Glass Nickel are all bland, uninspiring options. Then I discovered places like Pizza Brutta and Porta Alba that made high quality pizza. Unfortunately, this was "authentic Italian pizza," which I like, but which doesn't really do it for me-- the kind of place where people praise them for not putting too many toppings on the pie. I was still on the lookout for a place where the pizza was decadent and cheesy but also high quality. 

Then we moved to the east side and I found two places that fit the bill: Grampa's and Sal's. 

Sal's makes a fantastic pizza. My go-to option is the Forza: ricotta cheese, pepperoni, roasted garlic, and chilis (I get it without the tomatoes).  It's everything I could possibly ask for: salty, greasy, decadent and creamy. I'd give them 6 stars for that pizza alone. 

I'm less of a fan of their standard options-- too much sauce, not enough cheese, and I thought that the forestiere (sp?) was disappointing-- a little one note. 

Other small complaints:
-no delivery and not always easy to park 
-the space is small and poorly ventilated 
- it's a little pricy. 

Nonetheless, this easily gets 4 stars-- 4.5 really-- based on the Forza alone. Nice job, Sal's.

I tried Naf Naf tonight and it was...schmeh schmeh.

This is pretty much Mediterranean Chipotle. You pick a bowl or a pita and fill it with meat (chicken or beef) or falafel , rice, veggies, and sauces. Instead of paying extra for guacamole, you pay extra for hummus. 

I had a rice bowl combo with chicken, pickles, onions, "garlic sauce" (yogurt based?), hummus, the hotter of their two hot sauces, and a size of Naf fries. This came with a nice sized piece of pita bread and a soda. 

The pros:
- it's a nice space. 
-Everyone was friendly and helpful. We'll see if this lasts. 
- Their hot sauce is actually hot. Not ghost pepper hot, but definitely hotter than Chipotle or Qdoba's hottest salsas. 
- It filled me up and tasted pretty good overall. 

The cons:
- It was massively, massively overpriced. The combo came in at something like $13.50. For 7 bucks I can get a falafel and drink at Banzo or a delicious meal at Mediterranean cafe. This wasn't as good as either of those places, so why should I pay almost twice as much?

- The flavor was decent, but it was a bit salty, greasy, and lacking in depth. 

-Naf fries were a disappointment. They're not fries. They're freshly cooked chips. Not bad, but I'd prefer fries. 

-Nutritionally, it was a disaster. It came in at almost 1200 calories, 54 grams of fat, and 1450 mg of sodium. It was a big meal to be sure, but if I'm wracking up those kinds of numbers, I want to feel like I've indulged in something decadent. This didn't feel like that. I'd love to use this place as a quick lunch option, but I can't unless I want my waistline to expand. The real pity is that it doesn't need to be so damn unhealthy. Cutting down on grease and salt would make it taste better, not worse.

Edit: went back a second time. I skipped the conbo this time (no "fries"). It was much more affordable and about 400 calories lighter. One thing I noticed this time-- they're clearly under strict orders to limit the portions of toppings they put on. I didn't ask for extra, so I don't know if that would be an issue. Still 3 stars.

Edit: So after giving this place three stars I ended up eating there every day this week. That alone justifies a bump up to four stars.  I don't know what it is about their chicken shwarma pita, but I really, really like it. Nutritionally, this is a much better option than the rice bowl, especially if you avoid the fries. I'm also happy to report that they are more than willing to give you extra toppings on request. Just don't get tricked into the combo: it's a total ripoff.

This needs to be posted on every APS Yelp page until they consolidate all of them. 

APS is absolutely deplorable. They have a complete monopoly on Phoenix.  Consumers don't have a choice for power service provider and because APS knows this, they charge like old mob racket. I have had service with them, again, no choice, and one day I get a letter stating that I have a security deposit required. I had service at this new address for 5 months before this came to so I called. They told me because I was past the due date that they can at their discretion ask for one. EVEN AFTER SERVICE HAS BEEN CONNECTED.  I obviously have no choice in the matter. I asked them what past due meant. They told me after 13 days!!! My mortgage allows 30 days. The credit bureau reporting system is based on 30 days. The whole world works off 30 days. Past due after 15. Very crafty how the bill is due JUST before most people would pay their bills from their paycheck on the 15th. 

They charge me 1.5 times my bill for the last 12 months. Now remember, I have only been there for 5 months so rather than judge it on MY last bills which are low, I have to be averaged off of another family. So the deposit was massive. 
So I tell them (based on principal) that I cannot afford to pay it. So they say they will separate it into 2 payments (how generous). So I make the first payment of 80. Mind you, this is NOT for services rendered. 
Next month I get my bill in the mail, and like every month, I pay it.  

Few days later my power gets shut off.  I think its a building fuse or from a storm, but as I am walking to the maint office, I see the yellow tag on my meter. 

So I call APS and say WTF?? They tell me I was shut off for non payment. I quickly log on to my bank and see it was paid and I tell them this. They say, " no, it was for security deposit". I asked them what do I owe on my service. They said nothing. I said, so I got disconnected over an arbitrary deposit when my bill is paid in full? They said yes. 

They then tell me there is a reconnection fee and if I want it done that day there is 100 rush fee.  Now, this is all happening in the morning. I went to the gym and came home within the hour. So you know the service guy was within a mile. 

I talked to the "manager" and he was " nice enough to cut me a break" and not charge a reconnection fee. So I waited until the next day so I wouldn't have to pay the rush fee, and avoid reconnection. So because it was a cool 115 that day, I had to sleep at my gf's, WITH MY 2 KIDS!!!!

The next day all of my food was bad and still cost me over 100 for no reason.  

APS needs to be stopped and there needs to be regulation. 

Ryan.

I'm not usually one to comment on airlines only because every time you go on a trip each flight leg can be totally a different experience. However I think it's worth mentioning that this last time that I flew to Cleveland that this flight was no short of unbelievable.
Starting from the very beginning of getting into the terminal I got through security so fast and to the gate I couldn't believe it and I also had no issues getting on the plane the plane taking off the people that were on the plane as far as the attendance were very courteous they were not obnoxious telling stupid jokes as normally expected. 
It was just an all-around great trip very accommodating so as always I'll keep flying Southwest not to mention my bags don't get charged

I had been wanting a second tattoo for years.  I decided this weekend I would finally have it done.  I asked a few friends for recommendations but didn't want to drive out to the far east valley.  After reading the first four reviews for Divinity, I checked out their website and the portfolios of the artists at the Phoenix location.  I was very impressed and called to make an appointment with Ryan Campbell.  When I arrived at the shop today, I was very impressed with everything I saw.  The decor was gorgeous, everyone was friendly, and Ryan was very knowledgeable.  He was very patient while I decided on the size and exact placement of my tattoo.  After he was finished, I was extremely pleased, and spoke to him briefly about my next tattoo.  I'm already looking forward to making my next appointment with him.

Last summer, my fiance started experiencing moderate to severe back pain.  Upon the recommendation of my cousins, we called and were able to make a same-day appointment at American Chiropractic Center.  When we arrived, we were greeted very warmly at the front desk by Susan.  In fact, we were greeted very warmly by everyone we met, from the X-Ray technician to Dr, Amoia, the man who would end up treating Bryan on each subsequent visit.

We have been really impressed with the service and level of care we have received on the many visits we have paid to this office.  We have never had to wait more than five minutes for a scheduled appointment, everyone remembers our names, and when Bryan had to cancel an appointment upon the advice of the doctor he saw at urgent care one weekend, Dr. Amoia via a call from Susan called to check on him and find out what was going on.  It is clear that every doctor, technician, and therapist we have seen take great pride in what they do and truly care about the well-being of their patients.

Thank you, Drs. Amoia and Genet and everyone at American Chiropractic for the wonderful work you do and treatment you provide!

I have been dealing with the owner Tony since he was up on 27th avenue and Northern years ago. I have found Tony to be one of the most honest and upfront mechanics I have ever dealt with. He gives fair prices for repairs and usually quotes me in aftermarket and OEM parts prices so I can decide what I can afford. He has helped me with small fixes at reasonable prices and quick oil changes as well. He always takes care of my 60 year old mother, which is nice considering he could charge more but elects not to do it. He is certified all the way and I have never had any issue with his work after I leave. I trust this mechanic and ever since he moved down to 16th street, he actually has decent parking (thank God) and more lifts.

He is a good mechanic, one I trust and will continue to do business with.

Great place to go walking, climbing, and taking pictures. 

Holyrood Park is where I go for my morning walks, usually along the side of Arthur's Seat as the path's incline increases -making the exercise better for me. Sometimes I also go the other way, which is a "flatter" walk, but also has nicer views of the park. 

The view of everything is quite nice from Holyrood Park. The Parliament building is nearby, the multiple lochs, and the old ruins are all right there. The view from Arthur's Seat is amazing as well of course. 

I often have wanted to bring my camera with me to take photos as I walk around, the views are all impressive and on a nice day this place could produce some amazing pictures. I would recommend photographers to come and check it out. 

This is a great place to hang out or get some exercise. It isn't really a traditional park with stuff for kids to do, so be aware of that. But for family time or group walks, this is a great place to go and get some great views of the city and enjoy the green.

Yummm the croissants at this small family owned pastry shop are to die for. There are perhaps 20 different fruit and other sweet flavored croissants to select from. My favorite is the strawberry. I first decided to stop into this shop 3 weeks ago and I have been back at least 4 times since... I'm hooked. My favorite part about the pastries is that you can tell that the fruit fillings are made from scratch and God Bless the pastry chef for not being heavy handed on the sugar as to avoid the tragic syrupy-jelly effect. The quich are also very scrumptious with a light-flakey crust. The Lorraine is my fav and it is just enough to fill you, while not making you feel like a guilty glutton. Oh, and the prices are suuuper fair. I don't know where else in America you can get a fresh baked croissant for under $3, so great job team P' Croissant. I'm officially a regular.

Absolutely delightful! I will for sure be back for more of this heavenly homemade goodness. This ice-cream shop has a perfect variety of options from recommended ice-cream creations to shakes to kids ice cream with a plastic toy landed in it, they've got it all. Churn uses top quality ingredients that are definitely appreciated. I would best describe this spot as a step above Coldstone.

A bit disappointing for several reasons. First, it was not clear who worked at the store since personnel was underdressed. Upon opening drawers for the allotted sizes and styles that I am accustomed to being uniformly organized, to my dismay, I was overwhelmed with heaping piles of cluttered garments. This was surprising being that it was mid day and very few customers in the store and overstaffed, and it is not Black Friday. Subsequent to presentation displeasure, the manager asked me if I needed assistance with anything and I let her know which garments and sizes I was looking for and she invited me to the pile of clutter. I was a bit shocked that she did not acknowledge that there was no sort of organization to the stock and when I brought it to her attention, she advised me that garments are folded in the drawers at the end of the night it wasn't as if she was embarrassed and tried to tidy up, she left everything as it worse and continued through the store. She suggested that this is done once daily and that was very evident.

Been coming here for 5 yrs. Nothing beats their chicken lo mein. Then don't even think about the price for less than 30 dollars u can have lunch for 4 to 5 people!!!
Some says that their flavor has decreased? --pls tell it to the owner or the chef, it will help with patrons like us, or new comers. I had one time asked them to add more teriyaki sauce for my order and spice which they did. From now on when I order that item they know to put extra flavoring.

Sometimes our taste buds get used to flavors  and need a little more to get that same flavor were so used to. it's scientifically proven that the more we eat the same thing the brain we crave more of that flavor, :)

Iam used harkins for 4 yrs. And have been a Amc stub member for 2 yrs. We rarely use other movie house since I started being a stub member @ harkins. Today that will change! This place is awesome. A dollar cheaper on both AmC and harkins. A lot of parking spot even for a Saturday! Also they have the same as arrowhead AMC chairs- recliner.

Pros:

Alot of parking spot.
Cheaper than AmC
Reclining chairs
Less crowd
They always play international movies!

Cons:
Food is meh.
Finding it was a bit hard even with Google maps.


Overall this beats both harkins and AMC!

It's a good one - big, lots of parking and seating, and TONS of selection!  Went here a couple of weeks ago while visiting Phoenix!

All Sweet Tomatoes (aka "Souplantation") are good in my book, always consistent and fresh.  You know what you're going to get -- SALAD, SOUP, PASTA, and MUFFINS - done.  It's not good for a diet, you know that.  Too much temptation.  Hint: If you are on a diet, DO NOT GO TO ANY BUFFETS.   Pssst...here is a secret: If you have one plate, you will not gain wait and instead, pounds will shed.

They keep everything well monitored and maintained so it's always fresh.  I'm a fan of a good all-you-can-eat salad bar that's kept fresh!  One extra item just to throw a couple of more hundred calories at ya -- non-fat Dreyers Ice cream.  Both the vanilla, and the chocolate, are AWESOME!

I love and adore the chicken fried rice, but I could make sweet love all-night-long to the northern-style ribs.  How does one make love to ribs?  XXX is how.  Tender pork ribs, marinated for hours, cooked to perfection in a tangy sauce, and served with a little ramekin of Chinese 5-spice blend.  Pinch a little atop -- munch, munch, munch.  It's pure love.

Order "off the menu":
-- The "real" Ginger Beer; usually made with Kirin beer and ginger syrup has been replaced with a non-alcoholic one on the menu.  I have them make it with bud light to save a few calories, and still -- so good.
-- The "Stir-fried Eggplant" is awesome.  Except they no longer carry it with the minced chicken, only listed with the veggies.  Voila!  Available on request.  Yay!

I took some photos of the ribs and eggplant, and eek - doesn't look so good up-close, so scratch the upload.  Regardless, with the trinity of PF Chang sauces, I slather it all about everything I order...always great.  Like George, I like it HOT and SPICY.

No matter what you order, you get quality -- not authentic, but it is what it is.  Whether you get a Chinese Chicken Salad (adore), Sweet & Sour Soup, or the Lemon Chicken -- it's consistently good.

=======================
Location specific - Scottsdale
=======================

1.  Big location, lots of seating, and great outdoor area.

2.  Late night happy hour - yay!  When the temp of the nights in AZ are in the 70's --- sitting outside is supreme

3.  Yelp check-in offer, free order of dim sum - edamame potstickers (yum!)

Point break roll - awesome!  Soft-shell crab - best I've ever had!  I love Kyoto!

With choices to sit, eat, and drink at 1) the bar, 2) tables, 3) teppan table, and 4) sushi bar - you can live it up in many delicious ways!

Located near other good sushi places, this one you may not see from the street.  So I think this place is more known by the locals, and oh so good.

Very nice service, and less pretentious than the others just up the street.  I recommend this for a couple on a date, or a small group.  The teppan table seats 6 or 8, which is also fun for a little party, anniversary, birthday, etc.

There was no vent fan or heat lamp in the bathroom and a blown light bulb.

The shower head is awesome! Strong stream good temp. 25 minutes!

On entry, not so good. The place smelled of burnt cooking oil. Once seated, Lefty and I picked two apps and they are out; picked a beer, out; Lefty wanted a Sun Drop Soda, out; I pick a hard cider; not out but the last bottle. This was on top of the 2 menu items that they were out of. :0/ it must be my cologne.

I was so deflated, we just ordered a couple of available apps; the bbq egg rolls and Duck fat fries. We followed up with the fried Oreos with ice cream.

The fries were crisp and light, A definite plus. The BBQ egg rolls had plenty of meat but the shell was too overcooked and too crispy, which made the Q dry.

The fried O-R-E-O's were awesome! They are dipped in funnel cake batter and served smothered with vanilla ice cream with a sundae sauce drizzle. I would have preferred the ice cream on the side to lessen the quick melting and enhance the presentation (for Yelp photo). I learned after it was served (and devoured) that it was an option.

We had to wait, but there were plenty of empty tables :0(. The server (Kevin) was great; knew the menu and very friendly.

This menu reads great, but with so many things not available on a Saturday night it's just a good fiction read. Another point was that Left had a different menu than mine (old vs. new) 

Though I was really disappointed in this visit I will try again when in the area.

The patrons all seemed relaxed and happy, so this must have been an off night.

Lots of wine bottles on deck, I gotta step my grape game up

I'll be back.

I am a frequent here at both THE hotel and Mandalay Bay but this weekend changed that indefinitely for good. I would not think to come back here ever ever ever. Overall my stay here this past weekend was horrid because it was one bad situation toppled on top of another. Room was booked under casino in APRIL and we did a follow up a month before arrival and THE SAME DAY AT 6 P.M, but based on availability, our suite at THE hotel was unavailable. Maybe it would have been nice if they did a follow up. We called at 6 p.m informing them of our arrival but at 8 p.m, the hotel changed it by downgrading us. Mind you we had a large group and a dog (Mandalay Bay does not welcome pets) so we had to drop off our dog elsewhere. Very understandable because that is noted on the terms and agreements. Secondly, after going back and forth with the front desk, they informed us that a room would be ready in an hour because it was not clean. Arrival to the hotel was almost at midnight. So my group and I resorted to canceling plans on a Friday because it was too late to go out. They gave me a petty $50.00 for food credit then bumped it up to $75.00. It was a complete waste of our Friday night so this bootleg comp money could not buy our happiness. We got in at 12 a.m, and got into our room at 2 .am It only gets better, our belongings had to be hauled from THE hotel to Mandalay Bay and our car was at THE hotel garage to top it off. 
It the midst of all these issues we decided to move on, well that didn't happen.  We needed extra towels and that was an annoyance because it's so SIMPLE. Housekeeping completely forgot to bring the towels, fine it happens. I went down the hall to scavenge from them myself, then to find three different housekeepers that were unfriendly to say the least. I went to all three of them and they did not want to spare me three god damn towels. Is it that serious? I HAD TO CALL HOUSEKKEPING so the supervisor could walk me to where the towel storage room.
The hotel room was very clean ! Minor issues were a lot of the outlets not working at all. The a/c was not working sufficiently because it was extremely hot.
Valet didn't want to take my car and had to debate with the 118 degree heat on why they had to take my car in. That was insane because they wanted to send me to THE hotel parking lot, creepy and confusing cause that's where we got transferred from.  
Management called our room because they found out how horrific our situation was; mind you none of us complained what so ever. The manager was accommodating but again, trying to buy our love with the petty comps, she bumped it from $75.00 to $150.00. I felt as if they throw that in your face just to justify all the bad that went wrong, Nope doesn't work. 
On Saturday, our room was NOT CLEANED, and no we did not have the do not disturb sign ETC. We didn't call to complain. All I did was kept my mouth shut because I was trying to enjoy an eventful weekend. I had to call for toilet paper and toiletries on different occasions. 
What was supposed to be a three night stay turned into two night stay. We needed to vacate because we were very annoyed with this hotel as a whole. Coming back to this property is highly unlikely. What a weekend ruined. Never again !

I went to all three of them and they did not want to spare me three god damn towels. Is it that serious? I HAD TO CALL HOUSEKKEPING so the supervisor could walk me to where the towel storage room.
The hotel room was very clean ! Minor issues were a lot of the outlets not working at all. The a/c was not working sufficiently because it was extremely hot.
Valet didn't want to take my car and had to debate with the 118 degree heat on why they had to take my car in. That was insane because they wanted to send me to THE hotel parking lot, creepy and confusing cause that's where we got transferred from.  
Management called our room because they found out how horrific our situation was; mind you none of us complained what so ever. The manager was accommodating but again, trying to buy our love with the petty comps, she bumped it from $75.00 to $150.00. I felt as if they throw that in your face just to justify all the bad that went wrong, Nope doesn't work. 
On Saturday, our room was NOT CLEANED, and no we did not have the do not disturb sign ETC. We didn't call to complain. All I did was kept my mouth shut because I was trying to enjoy an eventful weekend. I had to call for toilet paper and toiletries on different occasions. 
What was supposed to be a three night stay turned into two night stay. We needed to vacate because we were very annoyed with this hotel as a whole. Coming back to this property is highly unlikely. What a weekend ruined. Never again !

Stooped by to pick up some muffins this morning.  They have a great deal.  Buy 4 large muffins you get 4 free.  Or simply you purchase 8 muffins for under $12.  The muffins are huge and moist!  Way better than anything you would buy at some grocery store.

I've eaten at this location many times in the past.  The food is great and so is the quality!  Good size portions and always something new on their specials menu.

The staff is friendly and efficient!

You can't go wrong with All You Can Eat at Sushi Mon!  You get 45 minutes of pure indulgence for $21.95 at lunch time.  The sushi rolls are large and taste so good.  Not only do you get sushi rolls you also get hot food options like teriyaki chicken to shrimp tempura to steamed or fried gyoza.  There are cold salad options too.  The main "rule" here is that if you order it you better finish it as you will be charged additional for unfinished rolls.  They have a great half roll option so there should be no issues finishing what you order.  

The service is great and you don't wait long once you start ordering.  We placed our order and within 5 minutes our awesome sushi started rolling out.  The waitress was pleasant and didn't look at us like we were big ol pigs for ordering so much.

The gyoza was fresh with a great filling that included cabbage.  The teriyaki chicken wasn't the best, it's all up to how you like it prepared.  The sushi was on point and there were a ton of sushi rolls to choose from.  The JJ roll and the 007 roll were great and try the royal California roll too.  The supreme Alaska was full of tasty salmon.  Ohhhhh the spicy tuna is the perfect amount of spicy and the Cajun albacore nigiri is great!  Damn me!  I'm hungry for sushi again!!! 

Parking was easy and there is quite a bit of it.  This restaurant is just below Durango on Sahara.  It's in between Cimmaron and  Durango on the north side of the road.  It's in the same parking lot and just a few stores away from Nothing Bundt Cakes.  Paymons is in the same parking lot too.

We walked out beyond full ready to pop from this awesome meal!

I wasn't sure what to have for lunch today, and I remembered I was close to one of the only remaining Farm Baskets in Vegas.  I guess I mentioned it out loud and my co-worker Angie got all excited....

Angie : "OH MY GAWD Y'ALL!  Do you go there ( Farm Basket ) for Cluckeeto Tuesdays?!?"

Me :  "No Angie, what's that?"

Angie :  "Ya'll can git 3 Cluckeeto's for $2.  But they don't come with sour cream, just cheese."

That was all I needed to hear. Farm Basket was all over Vegas when I was a kid.  They were even inside Pizza Inn, but, alas Pizza Inn is gone too.  But, fortunately 2 Farm Basket locations survived over the decades.

Farm Basket is a true "fast food" treat.  Best known for the "Gobbler"  ( a piece of breaded fried turkey breast served on a long roll with cranberry sauce and Miracle Whip.....oh mama!)  and best known by me for their fantastic turkey fat fried and salted french fries.  (YUMMMY!!!)

So....I had a Gobbler, some French Fries, and a few Cluckeetos.  I'm full....MUST...TAKE....NAP!!! Zzzzzz. ( See that means I fell asleep.)

Vegas and Henderson locals know of the secret and hidden charms of B.C. (Boulder City)  It's the tiny little town on the way to Lake Mead and Hoover Dam.

Right before you hit Boulder City proper there's a tiny strip mall that houses a phenomenal brunch joint called Two Gals From Cal.

Where to start.....their omelets are awesome....try the Olive Oil ( Mushrooms, Spinach, and Swiss Cheese.) or my favorite the Bullet Proof Taco, which is basically a huge taco salad stuffed in a fried flour tortilla shell.......FAN-FRIGGIN-TASTIC!!!

It's outta the way but worth it.  Make a day of it and visit B.C. there's lots to see, and I'll tell you all about it soon enough.

My son Daniel kept buggin me to try this place, but I was reluctant. No good reason. I just already have my fave taco shops, and plus the bland strip-mall experior just didn't shout "Eat here" to me.

But he got to choose where to eat the other night after his National Honor Society induction ceremony, and he chose here. 

I gotta say, my kid really is smart. Los Favoritos is definitely a notch above typical fast-food-ish Mexican. On my son's recommendation, I got the "breakfast" chorizo burrito (served all day). It was on a tortilla the size of a small planet, and stuffed full of savory & spicy meat, cheese, potato and egg.  My husband ordered carne asada, and Daniel got chili rellenos. They were wonderful! 

The service was ify, simply becuase communication was a bit hard with non-English native speakers. But they get an A for effort.

I guess I owe Los Favoritos an apology for judging it on outward appearances alone. I'll certainly be going back!

I know people who really love this place, so maybe I have visited on a bad day(s) or I am just extra-picky when it comes to my Mexican food. IMO, Valle Luna is just average. Although I admit the service has been good and the ambiance is nice. 

On our last visit, we were immediately greeted by a cheerful hostess and taken to a booth along the far side of the wall. Unfortunately the patio was full. If you get a choice, ask for a table outside overlooking the water. It helps the so-so food go down better. 

Pros: Big portions, lots of cheese, good service. 

Cons: Ho-hum food. Lots of grease. Can be too crowded.

It was like Studio Ghibli, Hello Kitty, anime, and kawaii awesomeness all rolled into one! Taking a breather off of the strip, I ventured in here to see if I could score some pocky and hopefully some Ghibli items. Boy, did they not disappoint! Once you step inside you can see the place is packed to the gills with goodies, albeit a bit small in space. I am not too fluent on my Japanese yet so I was grateful that they had some signs up briefly describing that some of the items were. 

Basically they have all of the foodie favorites in here from Japan: Meiji, puffy corn cheese curls, milk chocolate, chocolate crunchies, rice crackers, ramune candy, fizzy drinks etc. Fun bento supplies too. They have cell phone accessories, dvd sets, kitchen supplies, skin care (Hado Labo and the like), hair color, makeup, posters, and basically tons more which I will forget to mention here. I purchased tons of the very best sunscreen and a few Totoro posters. A must stop if you love this stuff!!!

We enjoyed our stay at the Aria while we were in Las Vegas just before the new year!

Pros:
Quiet rooms with good beds and fancy electronic controls for your curtains and lights
Spacious room with fairly big shower 
Easy access to the strip
Concierge was helpful
Easy access to high end shopping if you are into that with bridge to Crystal shops

Cons:
Expensive price per night
Not many affordable places to eat in the hotel - food was a mix of Asian, pizza, cafe style
Casino tables and games had higher buy in limits than most casinos
Do not touch the mini bar as the sensors measure the weight of the items

I would say overall if you are looking for a higher end quieter casino Aria is a good place to start! If you're cheap and want affordable gambling environment and food this is not the place for you.

I'm a fan of the El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, but this location is not among my very favorites. On this day, for example, they were out of the hottest salsa at their salsa bar. A shipment tomorrow was expected. And the drive-thru was closed. The workers are very nice, but they struggle with special requests. Today, I ended up with both sour cream and guacamole that I had requested be held.

Why keep coming back? The amazingly healthy menu for a fast food joint. They've added to their under 500 calorie menu. Lots of choices (sometimes as many as 10 total) with lots of flavor. I'll definitely be back. The friendly staff will take care of me even if my order is screwed up the first try.

I'm not a guy who's loyal to parking spots. When visiting the airport, I start with the possibility of a free ride and work my way through other options from there depending on time, promotions, people involved... So it comes as a bit of a surprise to me I'm motivate enough to write a review for the Parking Spot,

Why did I park here this time? No free ride available. Not away for a long tine, so just as cheap as taking Super Shuttle... And a discount card. Hardly a ringing endorsement. Checked in to a nice covered spot around 10 p.m. and was picked up immediately by their shuttle. So far so good.

Fast forward four hours. My flight was delayed, then cancelled. I called for a 2 a.m. Shuttle to come to terminal four and was returned promptly to my car. The driver radioed ahead and told the cashier that my flight was cancelled. At checkout? NO CHARGE and a free bottle of water. I actually felt guilty when I returned to the airport in a free ride later in the day, but the Parking Spot has definitely gained a loyal fan for the future.

Love the way they converted Matt's to an airport concept. Much more successful than the attempt made by Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. For those of you just passing through Sky Harbor, these are both Phoenix institutions worthy of a try.

I think Matt's effort here is more successful simply because they have their own dining space to manipulate, not a shared space. They use it well. Some tables. Lots of counter space for single travelers. Some communal seating. Lots of outlets. Great breakfast food early in the day and a full bar for later. Or breakfast food later in my case. A lunch menu is available as well. And it's all priced pretty reasonably for an airport. Well done.

These little hand made pockets of golden goodness are special. Really. I mean Radiohead special. If you are capable of pacing yourself rather than swallowing them whole, two at a time, when you actually cut into one and peek inside, you will see blissful dumpling elves frolicking in a coriander meadow under the warm, late-summer sun. And you will feel absolutely ZERO remorse for eating the dumpling elves alive.

Any of the steamed dumplings with coriander in them are the best.

I love Chinese food ("real" or western). And having lived in San Francisco, I'm always looking for a great Chinese restaurant. I really wanted to like this place for a multitude of reasons. And while it may satisfy some homesick cravings for those fresh off the boat, the food wasn't good enough for a second chance. 

Although you CAN dine in, don't. The staff are indeed really nice, but this place is dingy, way overlit with one of the most disgusting bathrooms I've seen in Canada. So if you decide to eat the food here, take it out.

Some of the dishes (bok choi shanghi style aka with lots of garlic and the pork w/ green onion dumplings) were delicious. The double-cooked pork was popular and might be good, too, but we didn't get it.  The lamb soup? Seriously? No way. Maybe I'm missing something but little fatty pieces of overcooked, tasteless lamb in a huge bowl of thick, pasty noodles and seaweed? It actually tasted like Chinese grocery stores smell. 

Place is cheap, however (all under $10 with the dumplings being 20 for $7.50). 

This one could fall down onto the one-star side of the fence if i weren't for the staff and dumplings, which were hand-made by a lady sitting in the dining room stuffing them with chopsticks.

My heart (and stomach) is wavering: who has the better chicken in town? Romados or Coco Rico?

Romados' chicken is a bit smoky and has different layers of flavor (tangy. spicy) I'm literally biting and chewing on all the bones. Fries are delicious with the spicy sauce...And do they serve them by the bucket or something?

Coco Rico's chicken is a different specie. Bigger, juicy, and meat falls off the bone. It's less flavorful in terms of spices but it's so tasty. The potatoes melt in your mouth.

Finish off with a Portuguese egg tart :)

Romado's is better... No Coco Rico is.... No Romados... No Coco Rico... You get the picture!

This restaurant is always the busiest of all the Portuguese restaurants in this neighbourhood. Delicious grilled chicken and lamb, french fries and a salad for 15$.  What's not to love about that! No fuss and definitely hits the spot, especially with the spicy sauce that I smothered on my chicken at least 5 times.

Must come back and try the grilled calamari next time.

This location of the Great Dane is OK but not great.... Went here for a quick beer with my buddy on 3 occasions and we just weren't really enjoying it. We wanted to play some pool but it cost some outrageous amount just to get the pool balls, I don't even remember the exact amount but it was obnoxious. It is always way too crowded and never anywhere to sit the bartenders have been very condescending each time we have been there and its just all-around not a very unique place. THIS particular location. Which it should be, being on the downtown loop near the capital.

I love this place. It almost has an underground L.A. bar type feel to it. I have been coming here for about a year now and it is always a blast. They have a live DJ (every time I have been there) and I am assuming that is all they have. Drinks are good they even have absinthe! Reasonably priced but can get pricey.

I will have to say that this place may or may not have great athletic apparel but not for the cost. Let's do some comparison, Under Armor. A company used by almost every pro athlete in current day and age. Even THEY do not charge as much as this place does. Yes, they have a very trendy store in a trendy area with trendy (and I will say knowledgable) staff, with trendy posters and trendy (as Ashley H. put) Kool-Aid. In my opinion this place has no other reason to be charging the prices it does other than it is Trendy. And is what Kim Kardashihoon or Madone-a wears. 

Again, it does seem to maybe have some quality product but can anyone really justify the price? Now these reviews are supposed to be opinion based and etc. So i can't judge anyone who shops here because where one person would think it was crazy to spend that kind of money on those kinds of products another person would do it until the cows come home.

So what i'm saying is yes it is overpriced even by probably the people who buy that stuff standards but maybe thats what they want to do. And finally Men's selection is microscopic. 

That is all!

So I've been sort of on hiatus from writing on yelp but The Boat House has forced me to write. I'm going to keep this short out of the pure frustration i have. I expected such a reputable place such as The Edgewater would have wonderful dining at all its restaurants but that is not NEARLY THE CASE. I am a frequent diner to as many restaurants in Madison as i possibly can and this is by far the worst dining experiencei have ever had in Madison... Ever.

The service was extremely slow, it took forever just to get water let alone drinks, the drinks were way over priced, we never got silverware until the food was delivered and when we asked for silverware, it took forever to get a refill on water and drinks, it took forever to finally order food, only saw our server maybe 5 times out of an hour and 1/2 time we spent there, the food came with half of what it said on the menu and then the server tried correcting me saying "that's usually all it comes with" (i was missing 3 items). The food was spectacularly mediocre, overpriced, and to top it all off there was extremely dirty silverware. I'm not one for one-time reviews but WOW i just can't help myself on this one. Madisonians will quickly learn not to go here but unfortunately they will still doop the out-of-towners and leave a laying bad taste in their mouths snit Madison.

I have yet to have a bad experience here. Peter, you are amazing and this is my favorite cafe in Vegas. Thank you for making it so easy for me to eat here... You are beyond accommodating with my vegan needs and everything always tastes so good.

It's located on Maryland parkway and Charleston. It's pretty tiny but full of delicious food. The pastry case is always stocked with vegan and non vegan options. *the zucchini banana chocolate muffin is so ridiculously good!!! Ask them to warm it for you and it practically melts in your mouth. The "cheesecakes" have never ever disappointed. The blueberry is fabulous! Never tastes artificial and the crust is perfectly crisp! The coffee has never disappointed, made hot and fresh, and always smooth. The melon waters... The turmeric and canteloupe is by far my favorite... It is a perfect summer beverage. 

The smoothies... We've tried the cocoa super food (smooth and delicious and hearty) and the coconut almond (light, slightly sweet, and thirst quenching) I would recommend either after a lifting session or yoga. Both are full of nutrients and electrolytes. 

The sandwiches... So far we have tried the good earth pita (stocked with veggies and full vegan goodness)  and the tree of life pita (our fav) very hearty and the dressing was out of this world!! 

The salads... The Thai peanut was surprisingly very very good! I wasn't expecting it to be as savory as it was and textures all blended surprisingly well. It was a day we split the salad and a pita and we were both very very full and satisfied. THE BIZZNESS, is exactly that, the business! We always try different options. You get to choose three options over chopped kale in a perfect lemon vinaigrette. So far we have tried the hummus, the babagonoosh, roasted beet and quinoa, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, spiced chickpeas, avocado... I think you get the Idea (so many options)! It's always a go to
For us and is always delicious. 

Their soups are insane. The split pea and lentil are two of my favorites. I would recommend checking out their face book daily to see what the days options are. They also had a vegan tamale that was put of this world. My boyfriend said it was the best tamale he has ever eaten. If you see one make sure to grab it.

I have yet to be disappointed after the 20+ times we have eaten here. I think it's safe to say, if you haven't tried this place, you need to. It caters to vegans and non vegans alike and I guarantee you, it will not disappoint!

Flying in from Ny to YUL was heavenly pleasant. The return was the total opposite though. Can dropped us off at Air Canada but me and a friend had to walk to the other side of airport to check in and go thru security. Not a soul was able to guide us. Luckily we figured it out on our own. Going through security can be very tiring if you have no patience. Im sure it's not just my face paced Nyer lifestyle...

The airport is rather clean though. There is Wi-Fi though if you need to kill time or reach someone. And if you are coming into the United States duty free has no limitations on bottles of alcohol! So you can drink your frustrations away!

Well you know how difficult it is to find a new stylist when you move to a new town. It can be a worrisome task when you know no one and have to pick a place.
I saw the reviews for Curl Up and Dye and I liked what I read.
Today I went at 4 after work which only allowed time for a cut and then planned to get either highlights and lowlights or just all over color when there is more time.
Shannon gave me a very skilled, carefully crafted bob which feels amazing! She is one class act!!
Many young people and also older women come here. Everyone who walked out looked fabulous!!
Everyone is friendly and it is a fun atmosphere. I am 65 years old and I swear it has been since 1973 that I have had such great listening to my wishes and execution of a style. 

I have an appointment already to get my color on August 1. Shannon is great!

If you are in doubt about trying out a new place, Curl Up and Dye will earn your respect and trust!!

Good stop for having some very inexpensive furniture and lamps we picked up for our new house (we moved here in June). As we already chose our living room furniture elsewhere, and we still have one very large sitting room, we got 2 basic upholstered chairs and 2 basic very simple hotel-ly table lamps and the Liquidators deliver for a fee.
Two lamps, $12 each, and two chairs, $29 each and a $65 delivery fee we are satisfied. For about $155 you can't complain. We had scored a $577 recliner on Amazon Prime Day for $169 and left some budgeting for the sitting room.
You can get huge TV stands for very little. We will be back!!

We went back today, on Sunday, to scope out end tables. We got a three piece set of coffee table plus 2 end tables for $141.

Now that delivery fee for our 7 items is really worth it!!!

We liked the variety of products snd the helpful staff. We appreciate having people who know dogs recommend supplies.
We need a harness so we have to bring Teddy in to be measured.
We got an aqua safety jacket for him plus a nyla bone, some hide chews, a portable water carrier and collapsible bowl, plus a ball thrower and a plastic ball which looks great for the swimming pool.
Isn't it just like having a new baby when you have to start out scoping out furniture and toys!! We are very happy with Teddy and look forward to being regulars at this lovely new store!!

Go big or get the hell out of Vegas.

Everyone should start their days off in Vegas with one of these. (I certainly wish I did!) 

They have fruity flavors which are yummy, but seriously, for the best buzz (or blur) for your buck - 190 octane with at least 2 shots of everclear.  Towards the bottom, it'll start tasting like ish, but keep stirring throughout and just man up! Guaranteed FUN for the rest of the day... and if you keep drinking, even more fun for the rest of the night... I make no promises for the next morning though. :D

[note: if it is particularly hot and you're walking the strip, please be sure to have water on hand...you have a very high likelihood of passing out...I would know. :P ]

I had only gotten dim sum one time before this one, and sadly, it was not the business.  When my friends called me up to meet up here, I was hesitant, but figured, why the hell not? :]  It ended up being a very good passive decision.

The place was packed, but service moved very quickly.  Everyone was picking and choosing and pulling things off of carts... it was great.  I got to try a lot of things for the first time, including something with shrimp and rice paper. (yeah, lots of foreign names that I have no idea how to say, nor spell).  Everything was also very reasonably priced.  I think that the most expensive thing was 3.75, but there were so many of us that we all got our full for under $10 each. :] 

Overall, it was a really good experience, the customer service was super and the food was really good!

I was impressed by the lobby as it looked more modern and chic than what I think of for a Hyatt, but once I entered the room, it was a let down. Awkward layout, small TV and popcorn ceilings, BUT the bed was very comfortable. The toiletries also included toothpaste and makeup wipes which were nice additions.

Valet parking is $28/night or $19/night for self, however the Chase garage next door has 24 hour parking for $14.

There's an Einsteins in the lobby which is nice for breakfast, but the only other food option is their revolving Compass Room restaurant. 

The gym was nice and spacious, with a large selection of machines. For a hotel, they had a better than average gym.

Overall, this hotel is not a bad choice for the area, but I would never pay full price for it. I also didn't like that they're not pet friendly. We got a great deal through Priceline, otherwise for comparable price I prefer the Kimpton Palomar.

A great dive bar has to strike a delicate balance between grungy and comfortable.  It should feel like the cozy little hole in the wall where the floor isn't that clean and the booths are slightly broken, but the beer and liquor are well stocked and the characters are colorful.  Think dirty enough that T.G.I. Friday's managers would be disgusted, but safe enough that you're not getting a knife in your side when you sidle up to the bar.

And in Las Vegas, Huntridge Tavern is that bar.  I head here a lot during happy hour and find a collection of folks who are happy to be drinking--the clientele is usually a mix of folks just off work, folks down on their luck and smart ass regulars lined up along the bar talking to the bartender.  There's a lot of attitude is this bar.  Go with it and you'll have a good time.

And Huntridge follows through on the crucial requirement for a dive bar: cheap drinks.  Beer is $2-3 from the tap, liquor was pretty damn cheap (for a generous pour as well).  It's definitely my favorite hole in the wall in town.

The Olympic Garden (or OG) is one of the better party-atmosphere strip clubs in Vegas with a female revue on the ground floor (ladies working the pole and offering lap dances) and a male revue upstairs (ripped dudes dancing for ladies).

Price:
Locals driving themselves get in free.  Non-locals coming in their own car buy 2 drinks upfront (about $25).  Anyone coming in a taxi will have to pay extra (about $30).

Talent:
- If you're here to watch the ladies, the talent's a little lackluster.  The ladies dancing seem tired and they're not physically at the level of a Spearmint Rhino or Sapphire.  That said, there's plenty of working the room and it produces a nice party atmosphere.  Just know that the dancers aren't going to take your breath away.
- If you're looking to watch men dance, you'll have a great time.  I brought a bachelorette party here and they said the male revue was over the top crazy and the woman were all having a great time.

Bottom line for the guys: if you're looking to drop thousands of dollars on insanely hot women, this ain't your strip club.  If you're looking for a down to earth place to hang out for awhile and be entertained, it's a solid choice.
Bottom line for the ladies: this is your place in Vegas if you want male strippers.

In Henry VI (Part 2), Shakespeare wrote "Let's kill all the lawyers!".  If you have a court case in the Regional Justice Center, you're probably ready to shout that sentiment every time you step foot in court.   

Hell, it's not the happiest spot in Nevada.  People usually come here and try not to get locked up, to fight over money, or fight over child custody--not the location for the happiest events (although the county wedding license bureau is on the 1st floor).  

So if you're headed here, a few pieces of advice:
1) the lines to get into the building are long (especially in the morning) so get here early,
2) court is not the place to be casual so dress conservatively -- guys put on a tie and a nice, white or muted color shirt with a collar; ladies, cover up.  You will be judged on how you look, so be formal and (to repeat) conservative,
3) the elevators will take forever if the building is busy (there are only 6 elevators serving 17 floors), so (again) get here early,
4) the Marshals/Court bailiffs are not joking around.  Check in with them, be respectful, and don't talk in the courtroom once the judge takes the bench,
5) court can move really fast -- talk to your attorney before you get there so you know what's going to happen, and 
6) turn off your cell phone.  Seriously. 

All that aside, this place could be much much worse.  East coast courthouses are older, more run down, filthier, angrier, busier and less willing to listen to the people appearing in court.  At least the Clark County Regional Justice Center is pretty.  The lobby is decorated in red rock walls and a three-story glass atrium.  The red rock walls have philosophical and legal quotes carved into them.  Many of the quotes are inspirational . . . or aspirational--summing up what our judicial system aspires to be. 

The court system is all about "hurry up and wait," so come prepared to wait, but remember that it could be much, much worse.  The court staff does a really good job handling a massive number of cases in an efficient manner.

Yikes.  Just yikes.  
As a porn shop with a live peep show nudie booths, I expected the place to be a little seedy but fun.  But wow.  This place scrapes the bottom of the barrel.  The girls look like they've fallen on hard times years ago and have been doing crystal meth ever since.  Now they dance here.  

To be fair, drugs and worn out women are a central fixture in the world of strip clubs.  But I have never been in a business that wears this truth so visibly.  The women here are hurting and not disguising it at all.  

I dropped a few dollars out of pity and moved on.

One of the worst hikes in the Vegas valley--mainly because it's not meant to be a hike--with one of the best views in Vegas at the end.

It's a short, steep and rough hike up the Frenchman Mountain's peak.  The main reason the hike is so difficult is that it wasn't designed to be a hike.  The trail is actually a rocky road to the radio towers that sit atop the mountain.  When the road is straight, it's covered in rocky "scree" that will shift under your feet and constantly threaten to send you tumbling.  There are some steep switchbacks that limit the grade of the uphill, but you'll still be breathing heavy throughout the hike.

Once you have complete the hike, you'll have the best view -- with the Vegas valley laid out in front of you.  It's a gorgeous view.

Most people do the hike only once.  The main reason is how rough it is to come down the steep mountain.  Some folks fall trying to come down the mountain, some folks have their knees hurting trying to come down the mountain.  It's steep and a rough walk down.

It's worth a visit, but not a regular hike.

Perhaps I made the mistake of ordering burritos when the drive-through person had said they were known for their tacos. After all, what good is a restaurant named Los Tacos, if you can't master the tacos, right? 

It was one of those days that I wanted a fat burrito. 
Cool thing is they can pan fry your burrito so that it gets crispy. However, the order was a bit more work for drive-through than expected. 

The standard carne asada burrito comes with beans and pico de gallo. You have to request for the rice, which is free. I paid extra to add the triple mixing of sour cream, guacamole, and cheese. 

I'm not used to ordering a burrito that doesn't come with what I would think are the basics. I mean, RICE is a basic in the U.S. burrito standard so I thought it was a bit weird to ask for it. 

Even with the additions, I'd give this burrito 2 stars. Decent, but far from good. 

I'll be back to give the tacos a shot in the future, but maybe not for a while with the choice of plenty other restaurants. 

The convenience of a drive-through is a definite plus. 
My burrito cost about $8.50, and I've had far better paying $5.50-$6.00 at some hole-in-the-wall places. And did i mention that I wanted a fat burrito? Mine was a skinny. :(

Yayyy =) I'm a fan.
Not only of the desserts (sugar) but, THE FOOD!!!

The menu is extensive and is, literally, a book. Kinda reminds me of the menu/book at Cheesecake Factory. YES; THAT much food!
Had the crepes with chicken, feta, and spinach. And nooooOOoo, I wasn't on a diet kick, I just like those ingredients.
Friend had the turkey club crepe; and another friend had the chicken and waffles.

The crepes were good but, after having tried the chicken and waffles; I wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish, I had gotten something more substantial like their pastas or their bigger entrees.

I know one of the chef's there so, he comped us our dessert(s). Plural =)
Had the banana split sundae and the...get this: "everything chocolate pizza," which was dark choco syrup, chips, brownies....ughhhhh, it was delicious.

The service was spectacular. Our server was soooooo nice. And when he didn't bring my drink in a timely manner because he forgot; he bought my next drink. Amazing =)

BLOWS SERENDIPITY AWAY!!!!!


p.s. It's open 24/7. Thank me later.

Dare I say that they are better than the Korean/Mexican fusion that is LA's infamous Kogi. YES, YES...I DARE!

The lack of help staff can kinda be overlooked by the fact that the food was YUM-O!!!
It's a small hole in the wall spot my friend always goes to so, he wanted to bring me there.
When we got there, we waited a few minutes for someone to finish their food so we could cop their table.

We got the bulgogi fried rice, fish tacos, and bulgogi tacos. All were pretty amazing especially since I'm comparing them to Kogi.
Their complimentary salsa and chips were good, too. All tasted homemade. They had all kinds of chili sauces from Chinese chili oil combo to Saracha to a Mexican brand I've never had before.

I was giggling that they had musubi on their menu.

The one major factor to this spot is that they are soooooooo far!

This is my new favorite theater in Charlotte.

No crowds, very comfortable seating, and a good selection of independent films.

On this visit, we were greeted by a very friendly "ticket taker", which really helped start this very nice experience.

The theater was empty in the lobby with the exception of the concession employee, who seemed very eager to make sure that we had wine, food  or drinks for the movie.

The theater only had two other couples in our movie, which was very nice......it was very quite and seemed as if it were our own "private viewing" of the movie.

The seats recline, which is a very nice bonus if you get stuck in a boring movie.  Usually the movies playing here are very entertaining, and since it is more comfortable than the other theater seating choices, it is easier to just relax instead of trying to constantly move to find a comfortable spot in your seat without going numb while watching a movie.

I look forward to watching my next movie here......

I have taken a ride on the light rail a few times now and I have some stories!! The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! 

Okay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?

I like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.

So when I first wakled into MacAlpine's {the restaurant part} I felt like I was walking into the 1955 diner from Back to the Future. Very awesome soda bar, with about every flavor of soda known to man. I quickly ordered a strawberry-banana soda and looked at the menu. For the most part it's a very simple menu, they obviously don't have fryers so the sides are kind of lame {bagged potato chips, really?} but I was not disappointed in the hamburger I got! Mmmmmmm! So delicious! Real cheese, a nice meaty taste and the bun seriously melted in my mouth - dare I say freshly baked? 

Now for the dessert! We got the turtle sundae and it was amazing!! The portion size will not disappoint, and the ice cream had the perfect texture and consistency. 

Really loved my first visit to MacAlpine's and I will definitely be going back for round two and three and four and...

I find this is one of the few Asian markets or grocery stores where when I want that hard to find sauce or noodle they always seem to have it and cheap. This place is nothing like your giant eagle so called Asian section and really has what your looking for.

They have a massive frozen section with everything from noodles, pot stickers to whole frozen duck. It even has a lot of frozen stuff they use at the cheap Chinese take out places. ( I know because I see the same packaged items in the store as they use at the Chinese place across from my apartment when their trash blows over) They also have a great selection of sauces and Chinese cooking wines. Stuff you won't find at your average store. A good veggie section and for the most part dirt cheap. Even if you have to give it an extra wash when you get home.

In the end it looks clean and the staff has always been helpful when I ether can't find an item or not sure what I'm looking for because it's not in English. It's a nice place to shop and find something new for dinner.

Saw Kings of Leon and Built to Spill here last night, and it was my first time coming to this venue, which happened to be 5 min away from my house and I didn't even know it. I'm from the bay area, so this outdoor amphitheater was almost identical to Shoreline Amphitheater back home in Mountain View. There are about three levels of seating with a lawn in the very back end (General Admission) and standing room in the front near the stage. 

I didn't take into consideration the temperature difference back home and here, so standing in 100 degree weather for a concert isn't quite the same as the bay area when it's in the 70's. However the bands were amazing and the sound was great. Drinks and food are a bit pricey (beers run for about $10 a pint and specialty cocktails were about $15 but did come with a souvenir guitar cup which was cool). We got radio promo tickets for only $10 so it was well worth it, also because we moved from our $10 seats down to a lower level before the show started so we got an even better view =)

Oh, parking was free, which I didn't know so that was a very pleasant surprise! I don't know any large venue that offers free parking to concert goers. You can upgrade to VIP parking for $20 but it's a madhouse getting out, so I'm not sure you'd get herded out any faster. 

I would definitely opt for an indoor venue with AC in this area, but for $10 and three awesome bands, free parking and all that, it was worth it to come here! I'm sure I would feel differently if I had to pay full price and tried to get the food/beer here.

Really cool irish pub that I never would have found out about if it wasn't for my friends who frequent it. (It's in the corner of a strip mall extending from pima to flw near the wendys in case you can't find it) We came on a wednesday night, relatively late, so there were only appetizers being served (1/2 off) and 1/2 priced drafts (any) and wines. Pretty sweet deal. The bar wasn't too crowded, but there were some groups there watching games on tv, so I could imagine on busier nights it could get really loud/rowdy. Tuesday nights we saw were pub trivia nights, seems like each night has a special which is nice. The server was super nice and very accomodating. I'll definitely come back, maybe on a weekend to see how the crowd is then. The food is really good for bar food too, and not to pricey, especially when it's half off =)

Iove eating here, it's definitely worth $14 after 10pm! 

AMBIANCE: 4 - small, limited seating in grill area! restaurant area usually always open! it's always clean and they revamped their waiting area with wooden benches! usually always busy with people! 

SERVICE: 4 - usually fast towards the beginning and slow towards the end! lol but don't you just hate it when they turn up your heat so you leave faster?! hahaha

FOOD: 4 - hot dam, meat is so good! Try the brisket salted with the oil mixture they give you (not even sure if I'm using anything right but it's delicious!!) their side dishes are so good! it's just worth every penny! it makes me wonder why fast food exists when you could just spend $14 eating here!

SERVICE: 4 - usually fast towards the beginning and slow towards the end! lol but don't you just hate it when they turn up your heat so you leave faster?! hahaha

FOOD: 4 - hot dam, meat is so good! Try the brisket salted with the oil mixture they give you (not even sure if I'm using anything right but it's delicious!!) their side dishes are so good! it's just worth every penny! it makes me wonder why fast food exists when you could just spend $14 eating here!

I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch. If that wasn't enough to stop making you eat here... I'll list some more reasons-

Agadashi tofu was more like watered down teriyaki sauce with a side of tofu mush.

Tempura with no tempura sauce, and it tasted old.

Waitress dropped an entire tray of ice water on my mom and didn't even apologize.

The best part was the table behind us with young children screaming... while the parentals were sake bombing like 18 year olds.

Clearly... a classy place if you ask me.

BTW, if you honestly give this place more than 3 stars, I really question your taste palate.

Definitely obsessed with this baseball food- I've tried the bell rd location and enjoyed it. Why not try it at the ballpark?

I wonder how they managed to kick it up a notch at the field adding Americas tacos instead of macayos and bring this local gem to baseball fans.

The food here is great of course burgers being the star.  The beach burger is my style but we tried that last time so we opted for the Texas BBQ burger.  Um,  HELLO.

Wish I could detail every topping all I know is- bacon and cheese always win.  The BBQ sauce glazed burger patties took me to my childhood backyard.  

Truly the French toast fries were my favorite of the day compared to the carne asada nachos, and cold stone creamery. 

I mean how do they beat ice cream??? The hot fried brioche dipped in maple sauce just satisfied that inner fat kid.  Sharing these is advised!!!!  The best part is they are served hot and complimented the BBQ burger nicely!

Take my out to the ball game because I want another burger & French toast fry experience.

The thickest, hottest dolsot stone bowl in the bibimbap business. 30 minutes into your meal and the bowl is still scalding hot and would still cook an egg. I used to get the seafood sundubu all the time, then one day I decided to try the dolsot bibimbap and have never looked back. Don't get me wrong, the sundubu is spectacular here. Great flavor, great clean aftertaste. And awesome banchan dishes. Friendly smiling chef and waitstaff dudes are really cool! 

Korean newbies: make sure to order the 'dolsot' bibimbap so you get your food in a hot stone pot. The regular bibimbap comes in a normal porcelain bowl. When your dolsot arrives, grab your metal spoon and start mixing up all the ingredients in your bowl, including the sunny side up egg so it all starts to cook against the hot stone bowl. And don't forget to mix in enough hot sauce so your bibimbap turns slightly orange - just right!

Mr. Tofu plays hard-to-get as he is only open until 10PM :(   There have been dozens of times when we crave Korean food after 10PM and we end up going next door to DJK, Honey Pig, Soyo or Tofu Hut which are all open 24hrs. 

Mr. Tofu is a Las Vegas classic. (and it's really clean, too!)

Still the best soondubu in the business. There was a brief lull in flavor due to a different pepper powder, but rest assured Mr. Tofu is still king! An extremely special soondubu flavor here, haven't found any other recipe that even comes close. Banchan are always made fresh daily and are consistently a well-balanced salty, sweet and hot. Don't forget to try the Dolsot bibimbap as well.

Mr. Tofu is boss! I would stack its flavors up against the best Korean in LA, NYC, SF, SEA and YVR.

I've been going to this studio (& its sister on Sahara) on and off for 4 years. I love them both. Pro: plenty of class options (from beginner to advanced) and styles (such as ashtanga, hatha flow, kundalini, and restorative). Con: it has an LA studio feel - but (pro) most of the instructors balance that by reinserting some of the more more ethereal bits of yoga (like beginning with a meditation and ending with a group "om"). My favorite for that is Willow. I've been proud to take several friends and my sister with me.

I've been a Panera fan for many years. It's always pretty good. There are plenty of selections -- good bagels, soups, and sandwiches. The staff are nice and helpful at this and all locations.

I'm not sure what it is (if my tastes have changed or the restaurant has), but the food (all of it) just doesn't taste as good as I remember. Still, sometimes you have a hankerin' for a pastry, soup, or sandwiches, so... it's a decent choice.

Recently attended the Classic Gaming Expo 2010 held in the hotel.   As both and attendee and as CGE Staff I can tell you both sides using the Tropicana as a convention facility and a hotel.

First the Good
Freshly remodeled rooms.  
 + Well appointed for the price you pay.
 + Mid range soaps (for the price) 
 + Quite rooms with nice glass and shutters to block the outside noise and light when needed.
 + Very comfortable beds at sheets that are at least 400 TC if not a LOT more.
 + Enough pillows on the bed(s) for anyone. No problems with bringing up more of anything you want.
 + Large flat screen TV.  pretty much normal for LV rooms.  If you watch it that is.

Nice pool area!  Not to small.  Not too big.  Lots of adults enjoying the pool and the view.   This hotel is an adults oriented hotel so there are not many kids around.  A point to consider it you travel with younger family.

Convention facilities that are pretty good in any book.  The rooms are kept cool even when the load dock door is opened.

Convention Facility managers whole will be on site and available to ensure your every need is met.  No arguments about sending down tech to adjust the sound and lighting for the rooms.  No extra charges for that service either!

Main theater and stage that is well equipped to make your convention dinner and event a success.

Valet parking that does not gouge you on either the price or the service.

Okay casino area.  Nothing fancy but it will serve your gambling urge if you have one.
The Legend's Steakhouse staff.   During our convention I need to ask the staff at Legends for more than one favor both in and out of the restaurant.  They came through admirably with exactly what I needed each time.  And they did one on time too!


The location!   Being right on the corner with New York-New York, The MGM, and Excalibur put you in walking distance of many notable things to see and do.  As you will see below the Tropicana needs these other things in order to attract people to stay.




Now some negatives that really sucked.

The Food!   No restaurant in the entire Tropicana served food anywhere near to the quality needed for the price they charged.  Save one. Legend Steakhouse.   Every other eatery in the Tropicana including Bacio, Havana Go Go, South Beach Cafe, etc, served mid range to crappy food I was sorry to have paid for.  Bacio in particular was a huge breakfast disappointment.  A crappy little dungeon of a place serving undercooked and watery eggs with dried and hardened mini-croissants.   I post a pic later.   The South Beach Cafe has Matzo Ball chicken soup that taste like it is straight from the can and is ruined further by being served in a paper container that falls apart minute after it arrives Suffice to say that if you stay at the Tropicana you need to plan for you meals at some other place with better food such as Denny's!

The on-screen room folios for you bill are entirely useless.  The only think offered in the current bill total and the ability to check out.  None of the details for your room are presented.  The Tropicana's folio system smacks of a 1980's computer throwback that is in need of a urgent update.

The parking just sucked!  At the time the Tropicana was hosting three conventions, Rollercon, Buffalo Soldiers, and Classic Gaming Expo.   While the convention facilities were handled well, the parking problems could have been mentioned before we arrived.   The entire covered parking was absolutely full when I arrived on Friday morning at 7 AM and remained a real bitch all the way to Sunday!  The Tropicana needs to build an new multi-story structure in the other flat lot to alleviate the parking issues!

The various WiFi rates.   Now I know we don't come to LV to surf the net.  Well not unless you were going to that kind of convention anyway.  But I have to say the Tropicana's rate are really over the top in this day and age of free WiFi as an expected room amenity to keep in touch.  The Tropicana's rates are:
$14.95 / day  for the room areas.
$16.95 / day  for the pool areas and it is a separate charge from the room areas.
$495.00 / day for the Convention Facility areas.  Yes $495/day!  And without guarantee  of usability!
The moral of the story here is to bring your own 3G or 4G mode/router with you when you stay at the Tropicana!


Overall I would count the Tropicana as a win for the room and convention facilities.  Just be prepared to walk for food and entertainment,  Thankfully those items are walking close to the Trop.  It's the only reasons I gave then three stars   But I really should have given them 1 or 2 stars.

Love Black Dog. Staff is friendly. Food is delicious. Stellar beers on tap. Totally worth the at times one hour wait. 

Strategy - if you are going on he weekend, arrive 20 minutes prior to opening to get in line. If the line is long already, put your name and QTY of guests in your party on the board and then run over to Bunny's for a round of Bloody Marys. If you show up during peak dinner hours, there will be an hour wait. 

Burnt ends - burnt ends sell out quickly. Make sure to get your order in quickly when they open. 

Platters - platters are a great way to sample several meats and you get two sides. They also have an extensive BBQ sauce list. For a few bucks, you can order all the sauces for your table.

Drink - they have a great beer menu with awesome craft beers on tap. If you like whiskey, there is a tasting menu for that too.

To go - you can do to go orders via phone, however the bartenders are really busy so it may be a wait before they pick up the line. 

Splitting the check - they have a cool tablet-based point of sale system. It is easy for the waitress to split the tab for groups and you pay at your table.

Group size - this restaurant is good for parties of 4 or under. Parties of 1-2 can get sat more promptly as there is seating at the bar. While I see people with kids here, it is not a kid friendly restaurant - very small interior,crowded, loud, not sure if they have high chairs.

This hotel is now called "Fortune Hotel and Suites" - so hopefully it'll be updated soon so that people can find the reviews (as I was unable to do before booking, unfortunately).

PROS:  
- Cheap for its location (near the strip, but barely within walking distance, better off hailing a cab out front).

- Smoke-Free and Casino Free - a (relatively) quiet place to retreat to after a crazy night on the strip.

- Family friendly (if that's a pro for you - personally do not prefer the abundance of children, but they didn't bother us either)

- Air conditioning (once you get it started) works like a champ and is not too loud. 

- Decent sized room (for the money) with a refrigerator and mini kitchenette area separate from the bathroom.  Nice sized vanity/dressing area also separate from the bathroom.  

- Free Parking


CONS: 
- Check-in took forever.  There were only 2 couples in line in front of us, yet we stood there for a good 20 minutes.  They had only one woman who knew what she was doing (Skip, and she was awesome!) and actually checking people in,  while some other guy (manager? relative of the owner?) buzzed around her and even jumped in to "help" and messed things up.    While we were standing there, someone who'd just checked in came back to say they had been checked into a dirty room, so that took even longer.

- You may walk in on someone or have someone walk in on you.   Remember that guy buzzing around?  He actually jumped in (without her asking) during check-in and issued us a room key while she was finishing the computer work.   ...a room key for a different room than she had checked us into.  Luckily we had read the reviews on the travel agent's site and seen that several people had this same problem and actually walked in on people, so we were on guard and caught this, and Skip fixed it for us before walking away from the counter.     We kept the deadbolt locked the entire time we were in the room in case they issued our keys to someone else later.

- The cleanliness is iffy.  Our bedding and towels were clean and crisp, but the floor was not vacuumed (as evidenced by the remnants of orange crackers crushed into the carpet from the previous occupants), walls were dirty.

- The parking is not in a covered or secured lot.

CONCLUSION:
This was a clean(ish), safe place to stay for pretty cheap, and other than the delayed checkin, we had no problems.    I've been in some MUCH WORSE hotels in Vegas for this price (bugs and nasty stains), so relatively speaking,  it could have been worse.  Would I stay here again?  Not if I could afford it.  But if it's all I could afford and it was a trip out of necessity, I would probably do it again.   

I understand the hotel is under new management and that may be the source of the service/cleanliness problems we encountered, maybe they haven't figured it out yet... Hopefully they'll get it together because the in theory a cheap smoke free hotel near the strip would be a great place to stay.

There is nothing very Sherwood Forest-y about this bar except the sign hanging above it.   It's not even very loungy.  It's just an opening in the wall of Excalibur's Casino with some bartenders behind it and some stools pulled up against it.   

BUT they have good video poker machines and the bartenders are friendly, pour stiff drinks, and don't tell you that you have to play 'max bet' on the poker machines to get free drinks.   We kept finding ourselves back here at several points over the weekend. 

While it's not really a destination, it makes a GREAT pit stop.

The campus is smaller than I expected, but it's super gorgeous and clean! They're also building things fast! Last month there was an empty lot... This month we parked in a garage structure in that empty lots place.  Looks like they're building a couple more dorms. 

The dorm rooms are amazing!  I visited a triple occupancy n it's very roomy... More so than I expected.  I also love that each room within the suite has their own bathroom.

Everything is in close distance.  Students longboard, razor scooter, bike, n walk to class.

I also love how GCU keeps the student body busy with fun events all the time.  it makes for a great college experience.  Esp for those who live & are stuck on campus.  

If you arent part of the athletic program, they have many intermural sports to get involved with.  It's so awesome! Keeps the students busy and focused on fun, positive outlets.  

It is a dry campus.  I don't know how they police that policy, but those that I've run across are pretty much into "clean" fun.  THANK GOD!

It was truly a blessing to see how many students actually attend chapel in the stadium and I even saw quite a few familiar faces at a local church we visited while out here.  

I gave GCU a 4 out of 5 stars because the do not offer physics which isn't a deal breaker, but def a slight disappointment.

Still Choose GCU! It's a great school to send ur children to!

Avoid this awful nail salon!!

Don't go here for any reason. Ever!!!! Seriously save your $$$ and save the physical and emotional pain you will suffer at the hands of these careless and apathetic people. 

My girlfriend had her nails done and it seriously looked like a blind child painted her nails. I sat beside her while she was getting her nails done. So I watched this take place first hand. 

She clearly asked the woman who did her mani to be careful not to cut her as her cuticles are very sensitive. This lady smiled and nodded not understanding a word she said... Then she proceeded to cut her several times!! WTF?!? 

At the end her nails looked awful. Check out the pics and you'll see what a pathetic job the nail tech did. The people who seemed to run this place didn't seem to care or show any concern. 

There are so many nail spots in Scottsdale, don't ever go to this place or you will be sorry. 

I hope this place gets shut down it is just plain horrible!!!

Ever heard the saying "Jack of all trades, master of none".  
Its a donut shop, its a deli, its a cafe, its a family restaurant, its an Asian fast food place...well, we found out differently

We were looking for something different for lunch so turned to Yelp and decided to try the "Ninja Bowl".  Then found there is no place with this name.  No street sign, no door marker legend, no mailbox.  Nothing.  We had to do some hunting and asking (I hate asking) and found out the truth.  There are four names on Yelp for the same address and same location:
1) Ninja Bowl
http://www.yelp.com/biz/ninja-bowl-phoenix
aka
2) Rainbow Donuts Bakery & Cafe
http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-bakery-and-cafe-phoenix
aka
3) Rainbow Donuts & Deli
http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-and-deli-phoenix
aka
4) Bobby C's Cafe
http://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-cs-cafe-phoenix

All the same address, phone number and location.  I charged it on my Credit Card and it showed up on my bill as Bobby C's Cafe.

Had a terrible time finding it and while I only tried the Sizzling bowl the cost of $8.90 for rice, finely chopped chicken and gluten spicey sauce plus small soda doesn't warrant another visit.

Well thought out flavor profiles, even the smallest items have attention to details.  I'd go back again and enjoyed my first experience.

I was enjoying a day of meandering around Cave Creek and was getting hungry for lunch.  Walked past Bryan's and caught a wiff of their wonderful smokehouse smell.  It built on me and a block past I turned around and decided to try it.  Saw several local office folk going in so I followed them. The pulled pork sandwich was excpetional, great texture and flavor to the meat. 

While I waited for my lunch I tried the two types of sauces from the condiments dispensers; normal and hot.  Alone, the sauce flavors seemed to lean too far towards tomato-ey for what I imagined BBQ sauce should be.  But when my meal came the flavor spectrum melded with the pork wonderfully.  Lesson learned:  Don't judge the BBQ sauce flavors alone, they gotta hit the meat.

My side was the potato salad, which I'd normally not think much of.  The Chef had used Baked Potato chunks which added a nice base flavor, then mixed them in with a thick, creamy dill sauce.  The baked tones complimented the herb and cream flavors so very well.  OMG it was tasty, I ended up finger licking that stuff out of the ramikan.

On the negative side, they serve lunch sandwiches in a basket lined with lightweight paper.  If any sauce gets on the paper it starts to get weak and can end up in your food.  Not  aproblem if you're a clean and neat BBQ consumer, but who is?  At one point I pulled a little bit of paper out of my mouth that had attached itself to my wet sandwich.  yuk.
Also, my bill showed that Cave Creek is hitting folks up with 10.27% sales tax.  Yowza, that hurts but it can't be helped.

Venue:  Fremont Hotel & Casino
 
Decor: Older, old school like Casino

Service: Friendly

Environment: Older crown, Older people

Food: N/A (although they had food, I can't speak on it)
 
Prices:  Cheap Gaming, very affordable
 
Debbie Downers:  I didn't win lol j/k (kinda)
 
Conclusion: This venue like other nearby Casinos within that vicinity is old school.  Very Dark, not as open spaced like the newer ones on the strip.  They provide affordable buffets (that I can't directly speak on).  The gaming is cheap like $3 min Blackjack, craps, Roulette, poker and more.  It's pretty much about superstitions & luck as far as if you favor one over the other.

Decor: Old school, Dark

Service: Ok

Environment: Gambling...of course

Food: N/A..can't speak on the grub

Debbie Downers:  Parking...lack there of around it
 
Conclusion: The Four Queens is no different than the Golden Nugget except for less like the pool.  (Or maybe they did have one but I didn't see it).  I can be wrong.  They have restaurants.  Cheap gambling, small bids, affordable...fun.  Good place to hang out if you don't want to go overboard.

We ate here because I wasn't sure where else I could eat gluten free on the strip! I really appreciate the gluten free menu, thanks yard house! However the gluten free menu is pretty small, I got the chicken sandwich as a lettuce wrap and they let me sub veggies for the fries. I wish they offered gf buns. The steamed veggies didn't seem steamed at all, they were very crunchy and almost raw...not flavorful, didn't seem fresh at all.
I did enjoy my cocktail jingerber something...it was strawberry and cucumber infused gin! On point
The restaurant is very dark and loud and our booth was so big we couldn't really talk to the people across from us. Our waitress was good but service was on the slow side, had to wait along time for our check.
Overall this is definitely a good place for a drink but I would try somewhere else for dinner.

Good concept...health food type lunch place and juice bar. The seating and decor is comfy and cute. The water is infused with mint and either lemon or cucumber, nice touch!
They have gluten free bun and tortilla option for their sandwiches and wraps. HOWEVER you have to order off of an iPad type tablet which is confusing and takes much longer than just ordering from an employee. And the gluten free bun option was not available on the sandwich we wanted to order. We notified the employees of this and they made us wait while they attempted to add the option to their electronic system. The whole ordeal took like 15min I wish someone would have just taken our order we were trying to get something quick before our drive back to CA! My aunt had the same problem trying to order a gluten free bun. The staff told her to select the gf tortilla option but they would put it on a bun. When our food came out it was on a tortilla but we didn't have time to ask them to correct it.
My mom got the Krayvings club and the bite I took of it was pretty delicious. The green apple slice was a nice touch and they give you a good amount of meat! The side salad is just lettuce and salad dressing.
I ordered a juice, carrot celery lemon and ginger. I order this same thing at nekter all the time and the sweetness of the carrot makes it really delicious however it turned out awful here! The lemon was over powering and I did not taste the ginger or carrot at all! This was probably partly my fault bc I tried to customize my own drink instead of sticking with the immune + juice that includes orange and the employee was nice enough to remake it for me. I asked to leave out the lemon the second time and it was still disappointing. The juice looked slightly orange but I couldn't taste the carrot or ginger.
Overall, I was disappointed with the service and the amount of time it took us to order. The quality of the food seemed hit or miss, I really liked the sandwich but the salad and juice was disappointing. I really wanted to like this place bc of the healthy and gluten free options but it's a little too expensive for the quality of service and mistakes that were made on our order.

I hear this place rocked, on par with Mandalay's Burger Bar - but different! So I had to give it a try, because Burger Bar is awesome!

They have a Burger, Fries and Drink combo - Sweet!

Note: If you show your players card, you get  $1 off , WOW a whole dollar. I love how the entire menu has a special blue column for "Players card" pricing and everything is just $1 less then the original price. They should just put a note at the bottom of the menu instead of repeating every price. 

Burger: I opted for the Lamb Burger. Cooked perfectly, it was delicious. I ony made it through half, it was so big. I wish it tasted like lamb instead of beef. The lamb flavor was so distinct, it was easy to miss.

Sweet Potato Fries: PERFECT!

Milkshake: Banana, Mmm! Best ever! It looks small but this sucker's huge!

I would definitely return but this place would not be the first place I visit. More of a I have extra time and already went to all my fav's, now what? Place.

I LOVE SUMO SUSHI 2!

It's my Favorite restaurant in Vegas - PERIOD!
$26 for AYCE!

Go with a good group of people if you want to try a variety of rolls. A huge list of appetizers are included too! Ahi Tuna... yum

Now what to eat... everything!
I remember a Johnny Roll (cucumber outside) was good and not too filling - like rice. There was a vinegared roll that also stood out. All the rest were good too. Just keep eating till you pop- you won't regret it!

- Just make sure you finish all your food or it goes to a la carte pricing!

This is a great lunch place.

I have had lunch here a few times and it is always a positive experience. The wait staff are always friendly and courteous.  The food is probably just ok but the wait staff make up for it.  

The food is typical American bar food.  Not hard to mess up.

The restaurant is also very good for large parties.  There is plenty of room and they have the ability to move tables around to accommodate.

I also thought the service was very speedy, allowing for a quick sit down lunch.

Threw up a "nearby" request for sandwiches on a trip to Las Vegas and Mr. Mama's popped up. I'm a huge breakfast fan so I slyly passed it off to my sandwich loving companions. 

Place was busy around 11 on a Monday. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes, but no big deal. Figured it was a good sign. 

My companions were happy with the Philly Cheesesteak and Ruebens. The side salad that came with the sandwich looked good and hearty, and I'm told the ranch dressing was good. I don't know if it was homemade or not though - doubtful. 

I ordered a Cali omelet as a scrambler. Brilliant as I'm not really a fan of omelets - never a good egg to stuffing ratio. It was very yummy - topped with pico, sour cream and avocado (ripe!). My ONLY complaint about it was the sausage was chopped up cheap processed patty sausage. I would have preferred crumbled sausage or at least a higher quality processed patty. (I am happy I did not order eggs with sausage patties on the side as I would have been very disappointed.)

Sourdough toast was also delightful. For some reason I was hungry for toast so it fit the bill perfectly. 

Service was good - friendly and fast despite being busy. 


Overall it was pretty good. I wouldn't say it was GREAT breakfast, however. I'd love to try a cinnamon roll (looked great).

Walking around in Old Montreal, looking for a quiet place for drinks and snacks, we stumbled upon Petit Moulinsart.  They had a fantastic courtyard in the back that was perfect for sharing some wine, mussles and frites. 

We ordered 3 half portions of mussles - tomato and corriander ($11), blue cheese ($13) and dijonnaise ($14).  Each order came with about 25-30 mussles which was enough to split between 5 ladies.  A small portion of salty frites came with each, as well as baguette for sopping up the delicious sauce.  We also got a bottle of red wine ($40).  

A nice start to our weekend in Montreal.  Happy we found this charming place amongst the sea of tourist traps in the area.

Absolutely a great hotel in the heart of Pittsburgh financial district. 

The service impeccable! I found all areas of the hotel well staffed with individuals who provided amazing helpful customer service. Starting with the front desk, who are courteous and friendly and really welcome you to the city and make you feel at home. The maintenance staff were also very good, they always made sure to greet us in passing and did a great job maintaining the hotel. 

The amenities and the hotel itself were very CLEAN. Exactly what you'd expect from a the Fairmont Brand. This Fairmont has a lot more clean and modern finishes than other ones I've been to, giving it more of an updated look. Of the amenities our favourite would have to be the GYM. It's open 24 hours to all the guests and unlike a lot of other hotel gyms, this one was fully packed with all the right equipment and a plethora of  cardio machines. Adjacent to the gym was also spa services that we didn't try but looked promising. 

Our room was great! We were upgraded to a "deluxe fairmont suite" that was equipped with a office desk, king bed and large bathroom with both a tub and a stand up shower. It was spacious and clean. Our bed was SUPER comfortable. Definitely a bed you just want to lay in all day. As a deluxe suite guest we received added perks like having a robe and slippers to use, turn down service, and special security pass for the elevator to access our floor. 

The location of this Fairmont is also great. Our purpose in town was to check out a hockey game at Consol Energy Center. Which was about a 15 minute walk from our hotel. Our restaurant was walking distance to a lot of great restaurants, pharmacies, market square, and bus stop locations.

I would definitely stay here again for my next visit to Pittsburgh.

Wifi was also offered as a standard service. However since we were connecting with new devices we had to call concierge and received our own in room router. Adding to all of this we were given a room with a great view of the city where we overlooked market square and the river.

The location of this Fairmont is also great. Our purpose in town was to check out a hockey game at Consol Energy Center. Which was about a 15 minute walk from our hotel. Our restaurant was walking distance to a lot of great restaurants, pharmacies, market square, and bus stop locations.

I would definitely stay here again for my next visit to Pittsburgh. It's a hotel that worth all 5 stars.

Found what I need at a price much lower than any I could find anywhere else. They worked just fine, and then we swapped them out. Plus, they recycle EVERYTHING - even the boxes the cartridges come in, gotta love that.

They have always been quick and courteous. I just bring in the old ones and they do the rest.

Perfect for us small business owners!

The place was alright, but the service was horrible, the food sucked, and everything in our paid for area was janky.  

We had a $6,600 bungalow in a prime spot, but the TV was busted, the ceiling fan didn't work, the ceiling fan was filthy (Bungalow 2), and our waitress (Ivana) was horrible.  Ivana cared more about dumping out liquor than actually assisting us in having a good time.  She literally made drinks 80/20 booze, with little to no mixer.  Don't get me wrong, I like a stiff cocktail myself, however, if you're trying to have a good time, over a long period of time, in 101 degree temps, you should probably try to throw some juice in the mix, and have a nice balanced drink.  Further, I understand that she's there to sell booze and make money, but she didn't do a good job with being polite, or acting in our best interest.  It was clear from the beginning that she just wanted us to spend a bunch of money quick, and get the hell out of there.  Every liquor she suggested was $2-$3k per bottle.  She kept pushing the big bottle of Gray Goose on us, telling us it's all about the show, and about how they bring it out with women on men's shoulders carrying cards that spell out your name.  We weren't interested in that, we just wanted to have a good time.

All in all I like Rehab a lot more.  Their prices are more reasonable, and their staff is more laid back.

Wow! I was so very pleasantly surprised with this place!

I had the Mahi Mahi burrito. There was delightfully flaky mahi mahi, rice, roasted corn, red onions, guacamole all wrapped in a delight flour tortilla. The serving seemed bigger than my head and came with tortilla chips that were perfectly crispy and sensationally salted. I sampled each salsa from the bar and have decided that the tomatillo is the one for me. I absolutely love that they have Vanilla Coke 'on-tap'. 

We will absolutely be back for more. :)

This trip to the ER was the worst I've ever experienced. I'll spare you the gory details and just give the highlights. 

When checking me in they did everything but call me a liar. They treated me like a junky trying to get some painkillers. They shrugged off my discharge papers from Urgent Care. I sat in the waiting room for a total of 4 hours. I got an external and intra-vaginal ultrasound, just to hear the CT Scan guy talking to another ultrasound guy about how I wasn't actually in pain at all. They insisted on giving me a CT Scan, telling me radiation wasn't involved. Liar. I refused. 

After another 1 1/2 hours of sitting in the waiting room, they finally bring me down what felt like every hallway in the entire hospital; which, by the way are all in midi-construction AND lined with patients laying in beds moaning and groaning - with handwritten signs above their head stating which 'room' they are in. 

The lady at the desk, turns out to be a nurse - she tells me to put on a hospital robe because I'm having a pelvic exam. an hour later when a male nurse comes in, he looks at me like I'm crazy because I'm half-naked. He hooks me up to a blood pressure machine and heart rate monitor and shuts the lights off on his way out because he says "You'll be here a while"...it's already been 6 hours. 

The doctor finally comes in and talks to me about my gall stone history...you know, the one I don't have. Then he says, "Well, looks like there's nothing wrong with you - you can go!"

Never again.

We tried Raising Canes by accident when a friend had some take-out at a UFC party. It was freaking fantastic! We went by and scooped some up for dinner tonight and was once again totally amped. The chicken, which is delightfully fried - was so succulent. Ridiculously juicy strips is what we're talking about here. The meals come with fries, texas toast and cole slaw - but I'm in it for the chicken. It's awesome and is definitely on my favorite to-go list :)

I told him that I called for tires cause I had a flat then, the guy said wait a minute and helped a guy who just wanted air in his tire so I waited for them to finish and he said how can I help you again and I said I would like a tire, then he asked for my keys said have. I been here before then said you can sit down now. If I wasn't form another city I wouldn't have come but I'm in a tight situation so I had to bite the bullet. Never again tho

Wow.. talk about a mess.  I recently had the ...joy or something like that... to fly in, cart a number of friends around, and fly out of this airport.. 

When I landed the first thing I noticed was the fact that the airport looked like it hadn't been updated since about 1992.. I was waiting for someone to pull out a huge cell phone to make a call.. it was also about 85 degrees inside.. hello AC? 

My next encounter with this lovely place was picking up my friends, as long as you fly United or Continental I've got no complaints, because they are located in Terminal 2 (where the hell is terminal 1?  it goes 2, 3, 4) but if you happen to fly into one of the other 2 getting to and from them is a mess.  

One day I had to drop a person off at 3, then go back to 2, and finally end at 4.  I think I looped the airport 18 times to try and find the correct route to do this.. 

The only positives I've got about this place are the free Wi-Fi, a billion food options, and the ease of security.

I never made the effort to try these guys over on Horizon Ridge.. now that they've moved to the District I had to try them! YUM

So I've never had pizza in Napoli.. I've had it in Rome and various other parts of Italy, and man this pizza beats anything I had in Italy! 

Ingredients were top knotch.. crust was PERFECTION. Service was ok.. nothing notable. Peroni was $3.50.. not a bad deal for an import beer at a restaurant in Vegas and it goes perfectly with their pizzas. 

Fiance and I wanted something meaty and tasty. Server recommended we get the salami (ok in Italian it's like salame or something). This was nothing like american salami (which I hate). This was like american pepperoni made a baby with canadian bacon and somehow this baby was tastier and had a better texture than either original meat. "Salame" is my new favorite pizza topping. YUM

First off, Ian made some killer recommendations on a apple turkey club and their seasonal cranberry smoothie. The sandwich looked exactly like the picture and was amazing. It tasted like something my mom would make with Thanksgiving leftovers. The cranberry smoothie was super light but still festive tasting - loved it.

Ian even came out and asked us later how we liked his recommendations, which I thought was pretty above and beyond. We really thought the service here was amazing. You guys are restoring my faith in Tropical Smoothie. I'll probably drive out of my way to come to this location again!!!!

It's never been a great place, but it's unfortunately gotten worse. We had the American Standard burgers which were possibly the most greasy burgers either of us have had from any joint we've been to. 
It oozed out of the burger and ran down our hands and forearms. 
Also, if you want lettuce, tomatoes, onions or pickles which are expected to come automatically with your burger, you have to ask for it. 
We had the appy of boneless chicken tenders which had maybe 40% breast meat. The sauce was hot, pretty good. 
We will not be back.

Lipstick on a pig!  What a huge disappointment.  Only a few rooms actually renovated but they BS you and con you when taking reservations and on their website, then hassle you when you check in and find out your room is not one of the 'newly renovated' rooms - a rip off!.  Renovations are minimal.  Showerhead sucked; one sink; nice 40" TV, but without HD signals why bother?  They invested minimal $ to renovate the old Alladin - would not recommend this dump to anyone!  Spend a few more bucks and stay anywhere else.   The Spice Market Buffet sucks - buried down in the basement/lower level; high walls make it way to claustrophobic and the food sucks as does the service. Best thing about the stay....Rudy the bellman took care of us big time with limo's, etc...he needs to move to a nicer property to make more money.

Casino was ok, Heart Bar was fun and packed, go-go dancers a nice touch but not a big deal; sports bar (Xtra lounge) is too small but make a good bloody mary on Sunday mornings; go visit but don't stay here.

I really don't understand the bad reviews.

This is hotel with clean rooms at the busiest intersection on the Strip (Las Vegas Blvd. & Flamingo). It's within a couple of minutes walk from Caesar's Palace, Bellagio, Mirage, Venetian, Paris, Bally's, Treasure Island, etc. etc. etc. It costs significantly less than all of those places and gets you right next to them. And it has a monorail station.

If you spend your time in Vegas like we do - which is out and about and almost never in the hotel room - you pay for location, which you will use frequently, and not for amenities that you may never use.

It's definitely a five star not because the hotel is five star but because you get tremendous value for what you pay - location, location, location. If you go to Vegas to enjoy the amenities of the hotel, then Imperial Palace is not for you.

Nothing else about this place really stands out. But, FFS, it's a giant pyramid made of glass and steel in the middle of the Mojave Desert. What else do you want? Dancing T-Rex's inside?

I'm writing this review from the new Sequoya EVP on Midvale and Tokay. Next month, I'm moving just down the street, and I'm pretty stoked about my new neighbor! The windows are tall, allowing great natural light to fill the room. I love the artwork and acid-washed cement floors. I look forward to many a lazy Saturday morning, waking up with my EVP.

When a top-notch bowl of pho is in front of you, there should be no talking. Don't talk to me about your day, don't remind me to get bread at the store. What the pho? If the broth has been cooking for hours, sucking every last bit of deep flavor from the stock bones, it can be a thing of beauty. Ha Long Bay seems to know how to do it right, pho real.

The bistro was packed on an unseasonably chilly evening; we had to wait a little longer than I'm used to for pho, but it was worth it. Fresh thai basil, crispy bean sprouts, and the usual pho-king hot condiments. Unlike other pho huts I've been to, there is only one size here (about $7). I'll need to give an updated review after trying their other dishes. If they can do pork as well as pho, I'm sold.

Waited till 8pm, gave up! 

I then called Henderson, 9min later, the cabbie arrived. Great customer service too.

if you want excellent authentic Italian cuisine this is the only place to go. Great service, delicious food made with quality ingredients. Franco, the owner is always there making sure everything is perfect. And it always is. We have gone several times and no Rmatter what we order it it top notch. Our last trip was Christmas Eve and I shared the the seafood medley or as the Italians know it as the seven fishes with my mother. It was a combo of a 1/2 lobster, crab, shrimp, sea bass, clams, mussels and calamari and we both had more than enough. My husband had one of the veal dishes and he said it was delicious and had a fabulous sauce. We shared the tiramisu and the maringatta both are great and can't be missed. You won't be disappointed.

Stopped by for lunch and it was difficult to decide what to have; everything sounded great. I opted for the Quinoa/Chicken Salad which was very good, the dressing was creamy and mild and from what I understood the dressing is made from shaved onion, the creaminess seemed like a combination of the onion and the quinoa. It was almost like having a pasta dish but healthier without the white flour. The portion was the perfect size.  My husband had the starter port belly which he loved, lots of large pieces of pork belly and vegetables. For a starter it was large enough for 2 people. Great Service, Great Food, Interesting Menu! We will definitely return.

The owner of some of our favorite Denver restaurants got his start at the original Roy's in Hawaii. I am not a seafood fan...but my wife is and it was her birthday.

My wife and I recently spent a few days here and we really liked it. The hotel itself had very good to excellent rooms. I always love when there is a separate tub and shower. I will say that the rooms are a little dated and not near as nice or wonderful as the rooms in the JW Marriott in Hanoi...but they are excellent rooms for US rooms. They are going through some remodeling right now, but we were far from it and I am sure that when they are done, things will be even better.

I know...the first question you are probably asking is, "with so many famous restaurants on the strip, why are you eating at a chain." We had just arrived and wanted something light and close to our hotel. We love their salads so we went. We found this to be a great Maggiano's. Service was some of the best that I have received at a Maggiano's. Prices seemed a little higher...but it is the Strip, what do you expect. Great views of the strip also.

I tried this place out based on the many reviews. I seemed to have gone on a bad day or maybe they had a new cook.  The man behind the counter was very nice and helped us pick out something from the menu while we made up our mind.  They have a lot of options which would allow for any combination of asian food one can imagine or be in the mood for.  I ordered the Spicy Szechuan with Tofu which seemed to have  out too quickly is my estimation.  The vegetables were hardly warmed up  and suspended in a huge amount of viscous pink sauce that had no spice at all.  It was so dense and cooled so quickly the veggies were floating in it like jello.  I can;t say I would recommend this place or that I'll be back anytime soon.

It's had been some time since my last visit to Ping Pang Pong so I decided to give it a try for our pre-holiday dim sum meal with friends.

We arrived around 1pm and the line was pretty long. We were seated by 1:30 at a table that was a little on the tight side for our party. 

Drinks and refills were plentiful, but the cart service was extremely disappointing. They were slow with the carts and despite us trying to flag them down, they were hard to catch and skipped us a few times which irked me and my friends. We eventually got their attention and got everything we had hoped for, but the bad attitude and service was annoying. 

The food ranged for just ok to downright flavorless. Service issues aside, I can't think of a single dish that stood out to me as being good and I think I can safely cross Ping Pang Pong off my dim sum list from now on.

I have had Honey Salt on my peripheral radar for some time, but always felt rather lackluster about actually trying them. I finally got the opportunity to give them a try for lunch and without keeping you in suspense, the food and service were as lackluster as I had anticipated.

They were pretty busy during lunch time but we were seated immediately. It took a while for our server to acknowledge us and throughout our meal this remained an issue. He would be attentive for a minute and then he'd disappear, promising refills and spare utensils and then not delivering on these requests. I resorted to flag several waiters and busboys down for a spoon to be able to eat my soup which was cooling off quickly and get refills on tea and water.

On to the food. I decided on the fried chicken sandwich since it seemed to have universally positive reviews. This came with fries and I opted for a cup of soup and bread pudding for dessert, which me and my dining companion shared.

The sandwich was nothing to write home about, it lacked any originality and didn't have much flavor. The fries were hard and under seasoned and even the soup was dull. None of the flavors did anything for me. The bread pudding was fine, but it was not memorable in any way. 

All the food just seems overly pretentious and lacking any sort of excitement in the flavor department. Even now, over a week later, I can barely remember anything about the food. 

I don't see myself coming back any time soon.

Late to the Frost Bites party, but I'm officially joining the fan club. I decided to make the very long trek  all the down to Boulder Highway to get my fix. All the hype is true, definitely some snow. I am no expert, but I know what I like and this was a treat. 

I decided on the green tea and strawberry with condensed milk, strawberries and mochi. The strawberry was fabulous, I'm a sucker for fruity flavors so of the two flavors this was my favorite. The green tea was a lacked a little flavor for me, but was still tasty. The toppings were great too. 

The texture was unlike anything I've had before, it's a little hard to describe but in a good way. The ice doesn't melt quickly, so it I didn't have to worry about eating it at lightening speed before it melted in the Vegas heat. I want to try cocount or mango next time for a change of pace, but I'll definitely be back.

Frost Bites hits the West side and I couldn't be happier. My first trek to visit them all the way on Boulder Highway was great, but having them on my side of town made giving them a another shot necessary. 

Even better than the first try. I tried the coffee with strawberries and chocolate sprinkles and my mom got the strawberry with strawberries. It was the perfect treat on this very hot summer day. Smooth and flavorful and yet still light and not too overly sweet. The perfect combination of flavors and texture. I can't wait for them to make their way to the best side permanently!

My favorite Scottsdale restaurant.  There's just something about this place that resonates with me.  Great steaks, chops and rotisserie chicken.  Their twice baked potatoes and corn bread are among the best. A fun place for casual dining and it's family friendly.

Update:  My wife and I came down to Scottsdale for a couple of nights (see review for Hyatt Regency Scottsdale) and planned to try someplace different but when we hit a couple of dead ends (Monday closures) we decided to come back here and I am glad we did.  We had another 5 star experience, maybe 5+ stars.  We were seated immediately at our favorite table (no. 27) which is ringside to all the action in the open and busy kitchen.  Bandera's cocktails are always near perfect and generous in size (Manhattan straight up and an Elderflower martini).  We started with their seasonal grilled artichokes which taste like an artichoke steak accompanied by their signature skillet cornbread which is almost a meal in itself.  We split an entree plate and added another side so we had just enough room left to finally try their banana cream pie which was good but not spectacular.  I had tri tip steak which was wonderfully juicy and cooked to a juicy medium rare.  Our servers and runners was genuinely friendly and attentive making our entire dining experience memorable and delightful.

I've been to so many PB's I could write 15 different reviews but I won't since this one alone with the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall food court one are the ones I frequent the most.  

I think the idea behind this restaurant is very good . . . feature fresh ingredients in a pleasant surrounding.  Their fresh baked cookies are not only delectable but dangerous if you have a cookie jones like I do.  I could eat a dozen sugar, snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookies in a heartbeat.

My favorite sandwich which others have mentioned is the walnut chicken on molasses bread.  Paired with either a small Cesar salad or a cup of soup, and you're good to go.

Always dependable, reliable, friendly and consistent pretty much from location to location, this is my go to fast food joint when I am around urban areas.  I only wish they would open one up in Flagstaff or Prescott.

Enjoyed lunch here with my son and a long time friend who had business in the area after our gathering.  I searched out a place nearby and the Alexis Grill was a logical choice based on its location and other Yelp reviews.

The three of us each ordered different seafood specials of the day which is not typical for me. Mine was grilled halibut with goat cheese topping that was quite good.  My son had shrimp and shellfish over pasta which he really liked while my old pal tried the salmon special.  Everything was made to order and served quickly.

We arrived early for lunch (11:45am) and by the time we finished the dining room was pretty full with business men and women which I believe is an at testament to its popularity.

This review is from a male perspective. The other reviewer and most women get A LOT more done than most guys but from time to time a litle pedicure is what most men are missing out on. I was in the area visiting a friend and she wanted a mani/pedi and brought me hear. We were the only ones there, sign of the times, but I've rarely been in a place that was so empty. The typical guy boss and one employ took care of us. I had a pedicure done, nothing fancy, wash/rince/cut/massage/dry but the "highlight" for what little I require is that the little leg/foot massage part was one of the better if not the best I had. 
I can't give more than 3 due to the atmosphere and less would be unfair because my experience doesn't require much. I hope they manage to survive because they are in a good location but having bought gift certificates and knowing Sundrop Nail Spot is nearby  amongst many others there it might be tough.

AUTHENTIC FILIPINO FOOD and so fresh!!! I came in and immediately received a smile and friendly greeting from Emily. So many choices to choose from that I opted for the fried akule, chicken papaya, dinaguan, chicken adobo, pancit, Shanghai lumpia, vegetable lumpia and desserts. 

The servings are big and Emily is kind enough to put the soup like dishes in separate containers. The lumpia and pancit were made fresh. I decided to wait until I came home to write a review. The food was so good that I am about ready to take a nap. I love that the restaurant is clean & the restrooms do not have that "ruin my appetite smell" very clean environment.

Service is pretty good, although I had to keep asking for things like cream and silverware, etc. The ladies restroom is mostly clean but unkept with paper and waste strewn about. While I was in there another lady got locked in the handicap stall and I literally had to kick the door in to let her out. I went to tell the manager about the problem with the lock and found him standing in front of the food service line, eating food and took plated food to another customers table still chewing whatever was in his mouth. I believe they did address the bathroom stall. Food is ok but I think a little pricey for its value and it took forever to come out of the kitchen.

I expected something very different being named Chada STREET. The ambience was on the fancy side and even had couches in the front for the drinkers. The lights are dimmed to set that romantic atmosphere like Chada Thai.

When you put street food in my head.... I tend to think of street food prices. Here they don't offer that. 

I ordered: 

Tom yum $10: I had to ask for no coconut milk for this since they only had tom yum kai. It's the same as Chada Thai and I think their tom yum is always great. Perfectly sour and spicy(ask for hot if you like spicy) 

Spicy chicken wings$7: it comes with only 5 but they were surprisingly good! It's a dry rub and has a little sour kick to them. 

Crispy pork belly $6: wish it was a little more crispy! I also had to sprinkle some salt to give it some flavor. 

Crab fat fried rice $12: very good! It had a great seafood crab taste. It could of used a little bit more crab meat. 

The service was very attentive. Our waters were constantly refilled and we were always checked up on.

I'll be back soon to try some seafood dishes!

PS. They played good music! (Crystal castles)

If we are traveling you can bet we are probably hitting "The burger place" in town.  I can't say I had huge expectations for BurGR so I felt it was pretty good but not anything special.  For Vegas and the price it's not a bad deal, but I can't see myself going back.  I am not being called to return.  We had the Farm burger and we split it since we were already stuffed.  ***Background*** we decided this trip was going to be more about eating out.  Anywyas try it if you like, if you do get Nicole (sweet and very easy on the eyes).

DO NOT GET COX PHONE SERVICE. 

We were sweet talked into changing our Century Link phone service to Cox Phone service.   The clueless tech fiddles with our phone for ninety minutes installing a huge phone modem in addition to our basic cable modem, screws up our fax machine, and has our phone number switched off.  When I had enough of his shenanigans and asked him to leave, he and his supervisor I demanded he call refused to have our basic phone service resumed. We are now without any phone service at all, and our business fax does not work.

After having dinner at the China Magic Noodle House around the corner, I suggested to our group of eleven a "field trip" to Lee Lee International Supermarket.  Everyone looked at me as if I were crazy to even suggest we go check out the supermarket.  As soon as we entered, everyone ran around like kids in a candy store checking out the different Isles based on ethnicity.  The kids had a ball grabbing all the Asian inspired candy their hands could hold. After we stocked up on Hawaiian Isle juice, Middle Eastern dessert food coloring, Indian Garam Masala and Heeng, some random Japanese flavored water, we left the store only to congregate in front and talk about how fun and kool this place is!

Ok, so I have been buying HP computers from Costco for as long as I rember, at least eight of them. About four months ago I purchased an HP laptop strictly for work reasons.  What a piece of junk.  I can live with the cheap plastic, etc--- heck, what can you expect for a 700 bucks laptop!  It frequently froze and then began running very hot. I was going to return it but by the time I got around to it I was two days over the clearly stated policy of ninety days. Oh well, my fault.  However, the final straw can when the battery died and refused a charge. I took it to Costco, understandably they were not happy but they actually refunded the entire price.  I spent a few bucks more and purchased a different brand.  They totally could have not done anything but went above and beyond customer service. I will continue to be a loyal Costco customer!!

Came here to see Wanda Sykes yesterday. I do not have a whole lot to say. The weather wasn't too cold out that night but the inside of the theatre was. And our seats were very tight, very little leg room. After sitting for awhile during the show I became very uncomfortable and had to get up and walk around. The bathrooms are downstairs and there was no door to the women's bathroom. Everyone coming down the stairs can see into the sink area.

The drink prices were very high; a can of basic beer was about $6-7.
A speciality drink like a hurricane was $10 each.

I'm not to keen on Asian buffets, but since there was American food I figured I'd give it a shot. There is definitely a good variety of food. I personally go for the more "American-ized" type of Asian food and there was enough of that and typical buffet foods like meat, chicken to fill me as well. The place is very nice (still resembling the old Tambellini's) and the staff is pleasant. My only complaint is the they havd a wide selection of food, but it was just... okay. Maybe it's because we got there around an hour before they closed, but none of the food tasted very fresh and up to temp. The bread was pretty hard and I don't think anything I tried was really too warm. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it was near closing, but it still makes me consider if I want to go back.

I anticipated coming here and seeing Cavo with a four or five star rating. I can't believe it only has two! Maybe it's because I've only been here for events, but I think Cavo is awesome!

I've been here three times to their "Vain" events. It's usually three local drag performers and a headliner from Rupaul's Drag Race. The place itself is beautiful on the inside. There is a lounge area, a restaurant area and the main dance floor that's stands next to the amazing waterfall wall. There's also a second floor that overlooks the dance floor and has a separate bar. It's hard to describe the theme of the place but I would describe it as new age gothic. Once you go, you'll get what I mean. 

The bartenders and staff have always been nothing but nice to me. Drinks are good, but can be quite expensive. I spent almost $20 on two long islands (including a tip). They also are a little stingy with the alcohol. I've never gone here and really "got messed up." Maybe it's because I'm too busy enjoying the show? 

I will definitely be back here for more "Vain" events. As far as coming on a random Saturday night, I'm not sure. From other reviews it seems the crowds are mighty different.

We sat at a table near the gold course and let me tell you it was absolutely beautiful

Pros:
* Spacious and very clean
* Free WiFi and great connection
* Many charging stations

Tip:
* Ask drivers to not use Freeway when traveling to the Strip: $35 versus $15-20 on the Tropicana route.
* For best taxi service- use Lyft (www.lyft.com) for airport pickup and drop-off. The drivers are extremely professional and polite and most of the cars come with bottles of water and mints. 

Cons (This driver deserves zero stars):
BEWARE OF THIS HORRIBLE DRIVER (hence my recommending Lyft)
Name: Jeannine Lafarge- middle aged woman with very manly features, thick foreign accent, tan skin, dyed blond shoulder-length hair, and glasses. 
Driver Number: 107625
Vehicle: 1435
Nevada Taxi Company: A-Cab Co. with dark green skirting and white body 

I had the terrible misfortune of being taxi driver Jeannine Lafarge's passenger from McCarran Airport to Luxor Hotel. I politely asked her to not drive on the Freeway. I wasn't mean or condescending at all but something immediately set off inside her and she started shouting at me in the cab and saying that it's faster and cheaper on the Freeway route. When I didn't succumb to her bullying tactics she started glaring at me and cursing "BULLS***, F*** this and F*** that" She said how I was a cheap New Yorker who had no idea what I'm talking about and had no right to tell locals like her what to do. "I am glad this is a free country because I can say what the F*** I want!" She was clearly mentally unstable and I didn't want to be rude back because I was convinced that she could have turned violent on me. 
She also was pulled over by a roadside cop because she ran over cones during her intense road rage. The cop had to remind her to stop the meter, and by this point it's my biggest regret I didn't jump out and tell the cop how insane and rude this woman was! After the cop let her go, she immediately started cursing at him then at me. 
I was so relieved when she dropped me off at Luxor but she didn't stop being completely rude, disrespectful and downright terrifying. I hope no-one else suffers the same terror as me.

Tip:
* For 45-50% OFF tickets: visit smartervegas.com. We found this more reliable than Tix4Tonight, where there are no consistent discounts and you have to keep calling for updates.


Cons:
I was bored out of my mind. If you're expecting something along the lines of Shanghai Acrobatics or Absinthe, don't.

I give KA props for the spectacular set (incredible moving stage), beautiful costume design and makeup, but unfortunately there are hardly any difficult acrobatic acts until the very end of the show. I was so bored I fell asleep until the aerial straps and wheel of death acts came on stage, which were pretty much the last 10 minutes. The rest of the show was just performers gesturing towards each other, throwing sticks, or climbing up and down the moving stage....the opposite of excitement. I wanted get up and leave at the silly starfish and seaturtle scene.

Personally for me there is only so much aesthetics can do. And while alot of people love Cirque exactly because of the magical costumes/grand sets/makeup, I couldn't handle the same monotonous fluffiness for 1.5 hours. I was hoping for more excitement in the form of acrobatics which sadly did not come.

Awesome is the only word I have for this store. Ok, this store is soo awesome that I actually have more than one word haha. 
I loved my experience here. I was here on Memorial Day weekend 2013. I actually did not even know there is a BR store in Northlake mall. This store is located to the right of Anthropologie. Of course, this store is very clean, sparkly and well-organized. But what I am most impressed with is that immediately as I walked in I was greeted, and well informed. I was told that they were running an additional 40% off on everything in the store except for men's blazers. The lady that greeted me even had a brief chat about the reason for the exception on men's blazers is because they are specially monogrammed and are custom made. 
The sale racks here are awesome, and to be honest, I only do sale racks in BR, one day when I am no longer student status, I will probably buy something full price. The only downer to this store is the lady(tall, skinny African-American woman) that was opening the fitting room seemed like she was ready to go home and looked irritated/bored. 
When I walked out of the fitting room, another lady (plus-size African American woman who is in her 20's) approached me and asked if she could help me with anything else. I said I think I am ready to check out, she told me no problem and could check me out, I liked how direct she is, even if she gets commission on the sales. She was extremely friendly, as I mentioned, I am a student, she said she would try to see if the student discount works on sale items. Unfortunately the system would not allow. But for all of you out there who shop regular price, know that there is always a 15% student discount at BR. 
I loved how friendly the staffs are here, minus the lady opening dressing rooms. I prefer this store over the south park store more. Mainly because I do not care about how nice looking the store is, the south park store recently was renovated to look like a high end hotel, the checkout area looked like a hotel lobby. The staffs here were much more knowledgeable and friendly.

Our pediatrician is Dr. Blank, and for him alone, I give 5 shiny stars.  He is very professional, knowledgable, and gentle & friendly to my 2 kids.  I always come in with a long list of questions and he is very willing to answer every one of them with a smile. 

The nurses and office staff are an average of 3.  Some are really friendly and others look/act like they wish they were elsewhere.  Since they are working with kids, I just expect them to be more approachable and warmhearted.  

Like all doctor offices, you spend a lot of time waiting in the waiting room regardless of your appointment time.  But, at least this office has a partition between the healthy and sick waiting rooms with separate entrances.  I also like the fact that there aren't toys in this room because who knows how often those are sanitized.  So I recommend bringing your own if you need to keep your child occupied.  But, there is a TV in the waiting room programmed on a kid friendly channel, and who can resist an episode of Dora the Explorer.  

The Summerlin clinic shares the parking lot with the Summerlin Hospital and other clinics, and the lot is often full.  However, there is complimentary valet parking that I always take advantage of.  

Telephone appointments are easy to make, and they always call with a friendly  reminder days before.  I was very sad to leave our amazing Pediatrician in West LA but am very glad to have found Dr. Blank.

I forgot that Mr. Tofu was closed on Sundays and my sundubu craving had to be pacified so we made our way across the street to Tofu Hut.  Half of the restaurant have stovetop tables reserved for patrons having the AYCE korean barbecue, while the other half of the restaurant has tables for the tofu eating patrons.  Although the bbq smelled enticing, I was there for one reason and one reason only: sundubu. 

I ordered my go-to: the mushroom sundubu.  The menu described it as having 3 different kinds of mushrooms, but I can guarantee that I only saw 1 type in there.  The enoki and the oyster mushrooms were no where to be seen.  And on top of that I ordered "medium" spice level, and there was no heat at all.  Nor was there any flavor.  I poured the entire kimchee side dish and some bulgogi into the soup in order to create an edible bowl.  Only after those measures, did I start to enjoy my sundubu.  However, it wasn't my original order.  

My husband seemed to enjoy his kimchi sundubu, but the "spicy" level, tasted more "medium".  So be warned, that you may have to order a higher spice level just to get some heat.  The bulgogi was very flavorful, and the banchan was not my favorite. My kids, however, devoured the korean pancakes, although they are a lot thicker than I am used to.  

And I don't understand why almost every korean restaurant that we dine at, there is only one server.  Poor guy is running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  He was trying his best to meet everyone's needs, but we had to wait a while for extra napkins, extra chopsticks after my son threw them on the floor, and water refills. And then we waited a while to pay our bill.

Craving pizza in Vegas is a tough position to be in because there seem to be a bunch of low end, quick options but not quality picks. We were really satisfied by the unique combinations available here and the high quality of the ingredients that they used on the pizzas. The server was very attentive and friendly and there was actually a small selection of craft beer of tap (a rarity in Vegas, where cheap beer and yards of icy drinks are the norm). Sadly, we discovered this at the end of our trip, or else I could have been persuaded to visit again to try a different pie.

I was first introduced to this original YC's by my boss when our office was on Broadway Rd. Now my wife and I frequent this business. The staff is always super nice with an inviting attitude. The food is spot on and they provide wax paper to mash down food/sauce into your bowl. By now you're probably aware that the key is to get as much food in your bowl as possible. If you're not planning on eating much, get the small bowl--you'll still be filled by the end of the meal. ;)

I definitely recommend dinnertime over lunch. For a couple dollars more you get the Alaskan cod option with the other meats, and ice cream (cone or cup, soft-serve vanilla/chocolate). If you are unable to finish your meal, to-go containers are only 50 cents each, quite a deal in my opinion! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves large portions of healthy food.

I had been eating at the Scottsdale location all my time in the valley, so decided to give the original a try. Lo-Lo's just recently moved into the building next-door, and the original shack has been bulldozed. While waiting for the rest of my group, I loved being able to watch the food being made through the window! Staff was super friendly and we were seated by Larry "Lo-Lo" White himself. I also really liked the atmosphere inside with the mason jar lamps and all. Looking forward to coming again when live jazz is being performed!

Now on to the actual food part. I ordered the #10 Tre-Tre's with a blue Kool-Aid. One awesome thing I noticed in comparing it to my experience in Scottsdale is that the chicken legs have waaay more meat on them. It's almost as if the meat on a breast at the Scottsdale location equates a leg at the Phoenix one. Definitely a good thing! The waffle was just as amazing as I've always experienced. I will be definitely returning to this spot.

Oh, and if you didn't read my review of the Scottsdale location, take my advice and ORDER THE BANANA PUDDING! You won't regret it.

It's ok.  I could be snob-bish & state that it's not even close to food in Spain.  But with the economy & airfare being cheap it's definitely better to go to Barcelona, Madrid, Malaga, or Cadiz etc & enjoy the food & beauty of a dfferent world.  But I digress.  If you want a cheap version of Spanish ham, the serrano ham & caramelized pineapple will do; other best items were the short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper and the mushroom empanada.

While in town I wanted to treat my mother to a lovely dinner because she had never dined at this franchise before. I had been years earlier with friends of mine and I said that time I had to have my mother try this place as well. I told her she would be in store for a great treat and that's what she got.

As we entered this place to put our name the list for a table, the line was out the door and there were many patrons sitting outside in the nice sitting area for there name to be called as well. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table. That was fine since we didn't have anywhere in particular to go this Saturday afternoon. 

The 30 minutes came and went fast by us people watching others going in and coming out of the mall. Once we turned in our buzzer it was still a 5 minute wait to get seated still. We finally were placed in a busy, small corner of the restaurant by the hostess. This was cool because it was just 2 of us and enough space for both of us.

Our waitress came and introduced herself within minutes of us sitting down. We looked over the menu for awhile. After bringing our drinks the waitress informed us that she was leaving for the day and another waitress would handled us from here on out. This was fine as long as we still got top notch service.

The menu was filled with all kinds of things, chicken, pasta, hamburgers, and things like that. I had a very hard trying to choose what I wanted to eat. It was either the Parmesan chicken or the Seafood pasta. I ended up choosing the chicken and my mother chose the 'glamburger'. Both were great choices. My dish came with 3 chicken breasts, green beans, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were out of this world!!!!! They were absolutely amazing. The chicken and green beans were good but I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. My mother enjoyed her hamburger and fries. It was a pretty big burger too. We both had tons to take home. 

Then came the dessert!!! How could you go to this restaurant and not order cheesecake?!?!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but I do love a Strawberry cheesecake and that's what I got and my mother ordered the Key Lime cheesecake. Only complaint I have about my cheesecake is the bottom crust. I didn't particularly care of it but the rest was delicious.

My mother really enjoyed this little dinner we had!!! I'm so glad that I was able to have her dine here with me for the first time!!! I'm sure this won't be her last because she is now HOOKED!!!! I'm sure she would want me to take care of the tab again also!!!! LOL!!!!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!! The food here was quite delicious, I don't know if I was very hungry or the food was prepared with thoughtfulness. I think it was the latter. I am familiar with this chain because my hometown has one and I love it. The service was ok, it could have been better but the food did make up for it. I ordered steak and ribs. The steak needed no other sauces other than what it was cooked in and the ribs were so meaty. I couldn't devour them fast enough. I ordered broccoli as well and it was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I wonder do they cook this good every day or was it just a good day to visit. Either way I can't rave enough about my food. The waiter wasn't as attentive as he could be but it wasn't a big problem. If I lived in Charlotte I could see me eating here quite often. It's a win-win situation, you get good food and at a great price!!!

After a late night flight into Vegas, I wanted to pick up some food, drink a couple brews, and plop in front of the tv.  I was starving but wanted something good.  But when you're hungry, you are willing to settle for almost anything.

I almost did.

Then I saw Roberto's.  It was fate guiding my famished self to somewhere good.

This is an awesome place that's open 24 hours! ! !  The nachos were fantastic: tasty meats, fresh guacamole and chips.  It  was a lot of good food for super cheap.  And at the end of the meal, I was Happy.

I know where I'm going for my next post drinking/early morning meal.

How does this chain place still retain such a local feel?

Allow me to count the ways:
--  the people working here try talking to me in Spanish (I applaud the effort) and then abruptly stop when I give them my "I don't understand" look.
--  each store is set up a little differently: meaning some locations look grungier than others.
--  the inconsistency of the food makes you believe they are actually cooking.
--  there is no dollar menu, volcano taco, or mascot to promote their food.
 
Overall, Roberto's deserves a 3.5 star, but I have to round them down even though they've filled my belly many a time in the wee hours of the night since the stuff I order is totally greasy and unhealthy and my heart just won't allow to give them four.  *thump thump, thump thump*

I love Fatburger and this location is one of the best in town. Yes, it is located in the Green Valley Ranch casino food court but it is open 24 hours. I'll grab a quick meal here before or after a movie or a late night snack after bowling. 

The guys at this Fatburger know how to cook! I usually get an XXL (double cheeseburger) with grilled onions, pickles and all-beef chili. I'm a low carber so I'll get it served in a dish with no bun. I love the beef here and I love how it is cooked in all of its own delicious burger grease. Sit at the counter and talk to the cooks while they prepare your dinner, and order a soda that you can keep refilling yourself at the self-service soda bar (wish they would add Coke Zero since I'm not a Diet Coke fan).

I love Fatburger's handmade milkshakes too (and their skinny and fat fries) but I've had to give those up due to all the carbs. But if you can, try their skinny chili cheese fries, they are the best. They melt shredded cheddar on them which is the key to good cheese fries. There are also a long list of possible toppings you can get on your Fatburger from relish to fried eggs to bacon and grilled onions. They also make grilled chicken and veggie burgers too, and both are good. You can also get your burger on a whole wheat bun or wrapped in lettuce.

Everything is cooked to order here so once you order you are given a number. They'll deliver the food to your table. Plan on spending about $25 for 2 people; it's not exactly cheap but it's convenient and the food is always fresh, hot, and served with a smile. And if you are a gambler at Station Casinos, you can even redeem your comp dollars here and eat for free.

What is there to say about a fast food pizza place? It's fine. Villa Pizza is just like Sbarro, you can get pre-made, crappy slices of pizza. You order, they throw it in the oven and warm it over for you. Nothing great but a decent snack if you happen to be in Green Valley Ranch casino. They have some meal deals on their menu board where you can get pasta and a salad for less than $10.

It's a giant convention center. I mean giant! You won't believe how big this place is since it doesn't look so huge from the outside. The halls are massive and can hosts lots of conventions at once. 

They have been doing some renovations so the bathrooms are nicer, and the common areas have new carpet and furnishings. There are some shiny new Coke machines ($3 for a 20 ounce bottle) as well. 

The biggest plus for the Sands Convention Center is that it's connected to the Venetian / Palazzo so it's right on the Strip (and during breaks you can walk to those properties for lunch instead of getting stuck at the ridiculously overpriced snack bar).

The biggest negative is the drop-off area. It is INSANE. There is one teeny tiny little underpass where you can get a taxi or have someone meet you. When I have a convention, I walk a few blocks and have my husband pick me up down the street. It can take a long time for cars to get through traffic just to turn IN to the place.

I love Harris Teeter have since I was a little girl it's just a great grocery store always clean, nice people (almost) but then you run into those people who act as if your are not in their league.  And I figure this much because of the kind of grocery store it is, well my money spends just like yours.  Any who, I for the most part try to always go to the u-scan thing where I can do it my self and get moving and not have to wait in long lines.  There is only one lady that help work the u-scan who actually sits there and do her job which is great because that's why she's there.  I went in there the other day and the girl who was at the main scanning thing was too busy talking to her friends that she wasn't paying attention to anything that was going on.  I had to stand there for several minutes trying to get her attention so she could help me.  She really wasn't interested in doing so, I think it bothered her that I needed help and she had to break away from her very important conversation.  Well I say if you want to have conversations go home, get someone else to stand in her place that will do there job.  It's not hard to just stand there and assist when needed.  More importantly I've noticed that lately the u-scan machines are always down maybe 2 of the 4 actually work.  It's frustrating because sometimes they only have 1 register open.  I'm really having issues with Harris Teeter lately they need to get it together.  Got a million and 1 stores in Charlotte and surrounding areas, got a new grocery store coming to town going to give the competition I'm sure so they need to step it up.

First time at Publix because I'm a Harris Teeter girl, the store is beautiful, love the set up.  Excellent, incredible, wonderful, outstanding and any other nice word you can think of customer service.  Hands down the best customer service I've ever experienced at a grocery store.  Nothing like Harris Teeter, they treat you like they are doing you a favor.  I went to this Publix Friday around noon, wanted to compare it to my Harris Teeter, so that after non I went to my store, seriously the customer service stinks like no body's business. They rarely acknowledge you, even the managers. They were busy talking about what they were going to do when they got off could careless that I was even there buying groceries.  Their attitudes are so sorry the only time they would realize something is going on is when they lose out on their paychecks. It's a shame, any way back to Publix a beautiful place, great customer service, the deli and bakery super nice. The only issue I had was the deli was slow. I was the only one in line getting something and they wasn't prepared, I waited about 15 minutes or so. But other than that it was a great visit, I can't wait until one comes the new one comes to Mint Hill.
Thanks Publix
Just thought you should no Harris Teeter there is better out there especially the customer service.

I have no shame in saying how much I love Panera!  I have always preferred Panera's coffee over Starbucks & I only wish they would open smaller stores so I could have it more often.  I love their rewards card too - I usually get a free item of sorts every couple of months.  Not only is the food high quality but they also have delicious baked goods, smoothies, etc - something for everyone.  The employees are always super friendly too!

This Alberstons is the place we stop when we need to make a quick run to the grocery.  It's super convenient for us.  The produce and fruit is usually fresh & you can actually get fresh fish, unlike most markets where you can only get frozen.  

The employees are pretty friendly and always ask if I need help with anything.  Prices at Albertsons are usually a bit higher than other grocery stores but they do accept coupons, which helps.  They stopped using the store rewards card a few months ago so prices are 'what you see is what you get.'  We typically do our grocery shopping at Whole Foods but will stop here if we aren't close to one.  They have a lot of organic options, even if they are a bit higher priced.  We always end up getting a loaf of the fresh bread when we walk by & smell it.  We are total suckers for hot, freshly baked bread!

So.... I made the huge mistake of coming to Feast on Thanksgiving Day with a group of friends.  This past Thanksgiving was our first in Vegas without our immediate family, so we thought we would do something fun & hit up a buffet for turkey dinner.  We got there early, around 3:30 p.m., to beat the dinner rush.  Hah! Two and a half hours later, we finally got into the buffet.  Once we all paid, we had to stand around for another 25 minutes waiting on a table to fit our 7 person party.  Once we finally sat down, we all headed to the buffet where we had to stand in line for ANOTHER 30 MINUTES just to get food.  The stations were so backed up, we were all eating in line when we finally got to whatever food we liked.  They were also running out of food.  Never again.  I will never, ever go to another buffet on Thanksgiving Day.  I know this isn't the norm & it was a holiday - yatta, yatta, yatta - but they should have been better prepared.  Next year, we will either be going somewhere that takes reservations or cooking at home.

Normally, this buffet is not that bad.  I've been there once before on a normal day & the service was great.  The food is mediocre.  They do have a lot of stations with a lot of international selections which is cool for people with different tastes.  & with a $10.99 price tag (with your casino rewards card), you can't really beat it.  Obviously, it's no Bacchanal, but it will do for a family who wants choices or the tourists staying at the hotel.  The best part - they have real gelato and it is delicious!

I think I like Timbers so much because it reminds me of home.  They have great food, which really surprised me.  When I first walked in I thought, "Oh, great.  It's dark, smokey & there are weird people playing the slot machines."  And then I remember that I live in Vegas now.  It's a tad expensive for my taste but the quality of the food totally makes it worth it.  Plus, they regularly send coupons to our house & that helps with the cost.  You can play video poker & watch any sports game you want.  They also have great happy hours & late night specials.  Now I'm hungry....

Usher Hall--- had a most tremendous time last night. Naked Classics--Vaughan Williams' Symphony No.5. Wonderful enlightening dissection of the piece in the first half. Then interval-- ice cream and tea or coffee! A lady was unwell and needed a stretcher and aid. It all happen quietly and skilfully. Great management staff in the theatre. 
Then voila, after interval over the Symphony played all the way through. I am in love with the conductor. He fair flew and danced with his arms and body getting the best performance out of his musicians. His controlled abandonment and lack of inhibition I can only guess gives the players a feeling of freedom to really enjoy themselves and play like never before; and do they did. The majority of #5 was soft delicate, almost iridescent.

Hats off to Usher Hall. Well staffed and so lovely.

Spectacular.  Really. Can't say rnough great things. Beautiful seating. Music choice and volume. Service lovely. And the food!  Sublime. See my photo of broccoli w/ almond shavings and garlic beans....... Can't wait for the lemon cake I've ordered. The menu looks divine.  Really creative interesting. Courgette carrot cake I think?  

My waitress,her name is Angus, really good. Makes eye contact. Is swift and thoughtful. Checked on me but left me be..... A excellent skill when waitering. She comes across sincere and genuine. 

Love that she clears away. No idea how that pleases me. The little table looks neat and tidy. I can stress out if table not cleared. It's odd but a lot of cafes in Edinburgh miss this simple thing.  Drives my bonkers!!!

Pooh he my lemon cake here. I drank my entire non dairy milk cappuccino. I meant to only drink half. It was soooo delish.

I'm in the Best Buy parking lot...looking for security cameras and a pay phone...

I dread the after-Christmas returns. You know what I'm talking about: standing in long lines, people in bad moods, hassle, and you don't leave with exactly what you want. Well, I was pleasantly surprised when none of that happened when I went in to return the wrong Xbox game.

I was immediately greeted and stood in a short, quick moving line. The employee that helped me was very kind and understanding. She even went to the floor and found what I was looking for. What service!

I'd say this was one of the easiest returns I have done. I appreciated the employees' helpfulness, patience, and just being nice. Thanks, Best Buy! You have great employees and I'm more likely to come to this location the next time I need some gadget-techie-game item.

I would come here again just for the experience, not for the food.

This truly is a speak-easy, and most would not expect what happens when you enter the place which makes it fun.

The outside looks like it was once a Hooters, that's because it once was ha ha ha. But you can barely tell when you get inside.

It is very dark inside, very swanky. I loved it because it was romantic. I wish they had real candles on the table, but maybe that is a city ordinance or because it would make the restaurant hotter than it already was. The kitchen is open (hooters give away number 2) so I think  that is what heats up the place. 

The menu's come with cute little flashlights so you can read in the dimly lit room, which i thought was a nice touch.

I ordered a pellegrino, I was expecting the bottle to be chilled but it wasn't. I didn't complain though. 

Our waitress was a sweetheart and very attentive.  

I ordered the Clams and Linguini in a White Sauce - I believe it is called "The gallows with clams" - It was alright, kind of soupy with no real flavor..nothing I would write home about.

My boyfriend ordered the "Sawed off sausage" but took it back. Not really any sauce and the sausage was just a little too spicy and he already had heartburn. He then ordered the "Al Capone Carbonara" - He said it lacked flavor, but once he added a little salt to it, he enjoyed it a bit more. 

So dinner was "Meh" to say the least.

We ordered the "Cannoli" for dessert and that was fantastic! SOOOO delicious.

So like I said we would come back for the experience and the Cannoli.. but thats about it. A little too expensive for the quality of food you actually get.

Have fun!

When we first adopted our Chihuahuas a couple of months ago, we took them to the VCA for a check up and the attendants there were kind and gentle with them.  They even called a day or so later to check up on them.  It was good to know that they also have boarding services which I think is convenient since we travel a bit.  

CON: The location is a bit obscure.  It's right off the highway and it's hard to see it.

The price is outrageous over there.  My babies needed to go back for their heartworm refill appointment and I called thinking this visit isn't going to break the bank.  Boy, was I wrong! It was going to be almost $300 for the both of them! I almost swallowed my tongue whole at the thought of spending that much money to get a refill.  Get this, they were charging $45 for the test, $45 for the doc's exam and $38 for the heart card.  Say what?

So, feeling a bit bamboozled, I called another vet and it's going to cost half the price for both of my Chis.  Shame! Shame on you VCA! I'm getting their files transferred immediately.

I think I may have discovered my favorite salad in town here. Its not a healthy salad by any means, but it is quite tasty. The Grilled heart of romaine salad. I think I could go back every day. The caprese salad was my old standby, but after being a little adventurous and trying the GHOR salad, I was hooked. Also, the shrimp on a stone, or lamb chops on a stone starters were awesome. I didnt get an entree. because that was enough to fill me up, that and all the beers :) I recommend this place if only for its salads and app's. Plus there is a great patio, with an amazing view of the city.

This place is a great place to stop in for some bar food on a Thursday night when they have their best bar specials but there's a big caveat. This place is on campus so it easily fills up with  large groups of drunken college kids during the week when school is in session. I've witnessed one of said kids puking in their cup as they attempted to take a drink. If it's a weekend, the youngins usually find plenty of parties to attend so that's less of a problem, unless its moms or dads weekend where it can fill up just as quickly. They don't even serve their regular menu on nights like this which can be frustrating if you forget about campus life from time to time. We stopped in last night during spring break for some $2.50 specialty pints and irish nachos and life was good.

THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE

When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place.

We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.

(PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)

Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.

The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.

THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS
We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.

MOZZARELLA
The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.

GNOCCHI
If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.  

LEMON CURD
We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.

$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.

I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

As a Coronado resident, I appreciate how this renewed space treats its neighbors: free cup of coffee. (They couponed my door earlier this week.)

Today, though, I paid for my scone and macchiato since I'd left the coupon at home. Totally worth it. The espresso is up there with Giant. And the dark chocolate and cherry scone was appropriately sized, not a big box bakery Goliath. Perhaps too much raw sugar on top. I brushed a bit off. 

The space offers a better feel than Coronado Cafe and Urban Vine (terrible name) did. Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly. 

Though no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me. 

$2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast. 

Welcome to the neighborhood.

Welcome to the neighborhood. 

UPDATE: Finally had lunch here. Just awesome. The server brought us some gratis potato tacos. Savory and delicious, but the double corn tortilla likely unnecessary. One will do. 

I had the Monte Vista torta and the standout components were the salty zucchini and buoyant focaccia. A bit pricey at $11 but a solid lunch. 

We had the back room for five of us. A bit echoey but cozy and private. 

Can't wait to try the cocktails.

This was a really great show!  Reasonably priced, very intimate venue.  The show  itself was amazing actually. I'm still wondering how he knows the things he knows. The woman sitting next to me was picked as a volunteer and she appeared to be hypnotized. She swore she didn't know she was doing what we saw her do on stage.  She was freaked out. This is a very small venue inside Bally's. The showroom is also running Tony and Tina's wedding plus the 50 shades parody.  I purchased a groupon for Paranormal, made a reservation and picked up the tickets at the Bally's box office.  IMO It's not really worth the extra $ for the VIP. You'll get in a few minutes early and will sit in the first two rows.   I was seated  in the second row and wasn't VIP.   It's first come first serve seating but if you are there about 30 minutes early you should be fine.   Frederic is very personable, funny and really good  at what he does.  (Love the accent) He includes the whole audience even way back to the last row.  He picks lots of audience volunteers so don't be shy. Unfortunately I wasn't picked. :(   But Frederic did use my friends watch for one of his tricks (for lack of a better word)  I won't spoil it. But it was amazing.  The next day my friend was still asking how did he do that.  Yes we did get his watch back. :). 

No food or drink can be taken in but they have a bar.  If you like illusion, magic and want to be left wondering how he did that then this show is for you. He really does create unforgettable moments.  Last little bit, it is family friendly content. Not sure if children are allowed in the shows but there was no inappropriate language or behavior.  Definitely go see if you can!

We stayed at the Rampart Resort in the Summerlin area for the weekend for the first time. The Rampart Casino is connected to the JW Marriott hotel. The casino has several eateries including a buffet, a cafe, an Irish pub, an Italian restaurant and a Starbucks. The cafe has a really good deal of a 4oz steak and lobster for $9.99. The casino itself is not very big but it offers a rewards program and they hold different promotions with great casino credits and cash prizes. They have a good mixtures of machines, but they don't have some of the more popular machines. They have a good number of table games but they don't have three card poker. The dealers were very friendly and interacted really well with the guests. The ambiance of the casino floor is comfortable but a little on the darker side for my liking. Overall a good experience.

My favorite resort in Vegas if you don't mind not being on the Strip. We love staying here when the kids are with us. There's bowling, theater, arcade, daycare/indoor play for kids 12 and under, really nice pool and the view of the strip from the room is just beautiful. Gambling not the machine and tables are great. There's bars and a nightclub. Food court with lots to choose from, multiple Starbucks, buffet and other restaurants. The rooms are modern and the bathroom has a nice deep bathtub.

Sushi in a farming community?  Surrounded by Mexican food restaurants and BBQ?  Huge risk in opening this place in "The QC" -- but it has paid off.

I love that the owner is very welcoming to patrons and they do a great job with sushi.  We go with friends often and love it.  Get the French Kiss and Big Foot rolls -- good speciality ones.  They have a huge variety though and you shouldn't be disappointed.

Lunch bento boxes are great combination of non-sushi and sushi combos.

Ulta is quickly overtaking my love of Sephora since it is so much closer and so easily assisible. They are also beginning to carry more high end brands like Lancome and Benefit. I like that they have a better selection of salon hair products as well as the drugstore brands. NYX is sold here and often goes on sale for buy one get one half off. If you're a follower of beauty blogs you can appreciate the NYX brand as an inexpensive beauty find. This particular store is huge, which allows for plenty of room to meander and shop. The staff greet you as you walk in the door and are always willing to answer questions or look for out of stock items if asked.

Ben's BBQ catered our summer employee (1000+ people) picnic 2 weeks ago at Floyd Lamb State Park. We are still receiving compliments from the employees on our choice of food. 

We had a menu of pulled pork sandwiches, chipotle lime cole slaw and peppered corn. For those with restricted diets (or kids) there were turkey hot dogs, veggie burgers and beef hot links. The pulled pork was simply delectable. It was tender and moist and had the perfect balance of smoke and flavor. The bread tasted fresh from the bakery and the sauces that accompanied the sandwiches were all equally gratifying. The spicy BBQ sauce had some serious kick! The cole slaw was outstanding, mixing chipotle flavor into a traditional southern staple was ingenious especially when added to the sandwich! The peppered corn was so tasty and seasoned people were coming back asking for seconds. They also served 300+ pounds of the sweetest watermelon I've tasted since I left the south. 

The staff were all attentive and genial. The guy who carved all of the watermelon in the 100+ degree heat, did so with a smile on his face. The owner of the business needs his own TV show, he was so entertaining. He socialized, danced and interacted with the employees all while overseeing the food service. This truck served all 1000 of our employees in a few hours without ever having a line or a long wait. They exceeded our expectations in every aspect and I can't wait to use them again for our next big corporate event. In the meantime I might have to hit the streets to try that BBQ again!

Finding indoor activities for toddlers is challenging in the heat of the AZ summer, but thanks to an invitation from my friend Jane B, I took my little one to check this place out this past weekend, and we had a blast!

The location is not the most convenient for me, but even considering the 30 minute drive, it was worth it to get an hour of solid playtime for sure... and of course, my son slept great after class too!

I loved the casual and extremely clean environment at Gymboree, and I also loved that there was plenty of time when we arrived to get settled and play on our own before the official class began.  The structured class was great as we went from activity to activity including climbing, sliding, jumping, singing, pushing bouncing, and bubbles too!  I also like that they break down each class by age, so all of the kids in the class we attended were close in age and activity level.

We didn't join, but we do plan on dropping in for class again in the near future.  I also hear this is an excellent venue to host a party, so I'll keep that in mind for the future too.  Thanks Gymboree!

Do NOT EVER consider staying at one of the Caesar's Entertainment properties. If you are injured and it is their fault, they turn you over to CCMSI which is their 3rd party adjuster and they NEVER have any intention of repaying you for your costs associated with the injury. My grandmother, my mom, myself and two others stayed in a suite at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas from June 18 to June 22, 2012.

The morning we were to leave, my 84 year old grandmother entered the restroom and fell into the wall hitting her head. There was water totally covering the floor due to a cracked toilet. She had out of pocket expenses associated with her testing and follow up care. There is a two year statute of limitations to recoup your expenses. She and my mom talked with the claim adjuster on a regular basis. Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc. (CCMSI) first adjuster was Joy Van Riper. She was replaced by Doug Buchanan in 2014. Ms. Riper stated her client, Planet Hollywood and Caesar's Entertainment was responsible for the water in the restroom due to a cracked toilet and they would reimburse my grandmother for her expenses. Doug Buchanan confirmed this fact to my mom.

We were told in writing her claim would be settled June 3 or 4 of this year, 2014. On June 5' my mom called Doug Buchanan and was told he FORGOT to have my mom sign a form for Medicare to release her records to them. It was explained that CCMSI had to repay Medicare for the part they paid on my grandmother's bills.

Finally today when my mom and brother kept calling them, Doug finally told my brother he should file a lawsuit, there would be NO settlement. My uncle asked Doug if he enjoyed taking money from 84 year olds. He said, "That's my job." Wow...such arrogance and so sad for all the people that stay at a Caesar's Entertainment property.

We called Doug Buchanan's supervisor, Josie. She told me she advised us to file a lawsuit. We have exactly one day, June 20 since the statute runs out Sunday. We live in Texas.

So I guess the mob is still alive and well at Caesar's Entertainment and CCMSI. This is so sad and illegal since they are defrauding YOU as YOU had to help pay my grandmother's medical bills through Medicare and it was THEIR admitted fault and not yours.

PLEASE, NEVER stay at a Caesar's property because if you get hurt, they will NOT help. Their properties include Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Bally's, Harrah's, The Quad, Rio, and the Flamingo in Las Vegas. They own others around the country. Please help spread the word about them taking advantage of the elderly and defrauding the U S Government through Medicare fraud. We will not rest until there is justice for my grandmother.

Ms. Riper stated her client, Planet Hollywood and Caesar's Entertainment was responsible for the water in the restroom due to a cracked toilet and they would reimburse my grandmother for her expenses. Doug Buchanan confirmed this fact to my mom.

We were told in writing her claim would be settled June 3 or 4 of this year, 2014. On June 5' my mom called Doug Buchanan and was told he FORGOT to have my mom sign a form for Medicare to release her records to them. It was explained that CCMSI had to repay Medicare for the part they paid on my grandmother's bills.

Finally today when my mom and brother kept calling them, Doug finally told my brother he should file a lawsuit, there would be NO settlement. My uncle asked Doug if he enjoyed taking money from 84 year olds. He said, "That's my job." Wow...such arrogance and so sad for all the people that stay at a Caesar's Entertainment property.

We called Doug Buchanan's supervisor, Josie. She told me she advised us to file a lawsuit. We have exactly one day, June 20 since the statute runs out Sunday. We live in Texas.

So I guess the mob is still alive and well at Caesar's Entertainment and CCMSI. This is so sad and illegal since they are defrauding YOU as YOU had to help pay my grandmother's medical bills through Medicare and it was THEIR admitted fault and not yours.

PLEASE, NEVER stay at a Caesar's property because if you get hurt, they will NOT help. Their properties include Caesar's Palace, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Bally's, Harrah's, The Quad, Rio, and the Flamingo in Las Vegas. They own others around the country. Please help spread the word about them taking advantage of the elderly and defrauding the U S Government through Medicare fraud. We will not rest until there is justice for my grandmother.

I love this place! Going to Lolo's is always a delicious treat for me. You can't eat fried chicken and waffles everyday, after all. 

Lolo's recently relocated slightly north on Scottsdale, to a much larger and nicer space. Now an independent building, the new Lolo's features a hip indoor/outdoor bar. Although the old location served alcohol, now it feels like an attractive destination for a drink. I plan on coming here just for drinks in the future. 

I ate dinner at Lolo's shortly after the move and am very pleased with the experience. Everything we ordered was amazing as expected. The portions were huge! Our waitress was sweet and prompt with our food and drinks. 

Tip: order the chicken and waffles. If you're feeling especially malnourished, add a side of mac and cheese. No matter what you order, I promise you won't leave hungry! But most importantly, don't forget the koolaid!!!!

Decided to try out Yoga Lamar because it's close to my house and there was a Yelp deal available (basically half-off a month membership). I had high expectations after reading the other reviews but sad to say that Yoga Lamar didn't meet them. While I should have known that this wouldn't be an authentic yoga experience because it is located inside the salon, I was still disappointed.

The yoga studio is located inside Spa Lamar, next to the hair stylist area. The doors to the yoga room are thin so you can hear the hair stylists and their clients throughout your yoga class. This is distracting and doesn't make for a very "zen" experience. The room itself is clean and bright. The room isn't very big but thankfully the classes I went to were small. It would be uncomfortable to have more than 10 or 15 people in there at one time. The AC was broken during one of the classes I attended, so we were really sweaty about halfway through the class. Someone asked the instructor to turn on the AC, but it was broken, so we opened the doors to the room. It felt much better temperature-wise, but the noise level from the salon increased, making it harder to meditate.

Being that this is a Scottsdale yoga studio, the other students were mainly older, stay-at-home housewives. The women didn't give off friendly vibes, so I felt out of place not knowing anyone else. The atmosphere felt a little gossipy and cliquey, which is an unfortunate vibe for a yoga studio. On more than one occasion, some students in the class were chatty throughout the practice, making meditation difficult. One comment I heard during class was, "My butt will look so good after this position! I am so fat." UGH. I like yoga studios where students don't speak throughout class, unless they need help from the instructor. This is not a gym hour with your girlfriends; it's a meditative yoga class.  

The instructor for one of my classes was wearing a very thin, white tank-top without anything underneath. Needless to say, some of her body parts were poppin' out of the tank-top - very unprofessional and distracting during the class. While I'm not asking for 100% modesty, at a minimum you should have your nips covered! I was not happy about that and felt uncomfortable during the class. I made it a point to avoid her classes after that experience with her.

I am disappointed to report that I haven't received any contact from the studio after my month-long membership ended. I didn't feel like a valued client when I was there, and I still don't feel valued as there has been no follow-up communication. Why not call me and see how my experience was, and try to get me back in on a regular membership? Don't you want your Yelp-deal clients to become regular clients?

I tried to pry it out of them: What is the addictive chemical that Cartel puts in their coffee? Being a Denverite, I had to know: what can I do to get my fix while I'm not in Scottsdale?

Instead he gave me a list of his favorite coffee shops in Denver. Awesome service, amazing coffee and possibly an addictive chemical that creates the illusion of the best Iced Vanilla Latte you've ever had. 

This location serves local beer and wine as well. I'll try to make it back for happy hour.

Last minute shop, got home, found missing accessories, got to go back to the store where you purchase is the only solution, u can't pick up from other location, no transfer stock or delivery with each other branch. 
A plus for the patience, friendly, and fast customer service and the manager very cooperative. 
Still love to recommended this place, just make you check all u need especially for accesories before you go home.

It's my first time in here. As server referenced, we ordered Mariscado and it was BOMB! I loved it!

All the menu are about  the shrimp, calamari, fish, and seafood. I would like to go back (ASAP!) to try everything else! LOL! Call me if you guys need a company :-p! I am happy to come back again! :)

The service was fast, although the server couldn't speak English, but she understand English. 

The flavors was awesome, fishy but great! (Off course, it's a seafood restaurant, Duh).

The indoor decor very ordinary which is a plus because I felt like really in Mexico. From outside looked small but when you enter, it will be enough for everybody.

This place even have a musician to play the music as your requested, but he just say hi to us and left..lol...

So, Yes, I would like to recommended this place!

I am a recent Food City convert. I used to only go when I needed hominy in bulk and couldn't find it in the grocery store. I now shop here on a much more regular basis for 2 reasons. 

1. Cheap ass produce. Seriously 8 cucumbers for $1 and 3 pounds of roma tomatoes for $1. Ridiculous. I have a juicer so we use A LOT of produce and Food City has 80% cheaper produce than any other grocery stores in the state. 

2. Cheap ass spices - I recently made Puerco pibil and needed Anchiote, I found it for $2 in a small bag. The only other store I found that carried it was charging over $12, no lie. 

So I can't vouch for the rest of the store, but if you need spices or produce the is THE SPOT!

Okay,  I'll admit it.  On this here occasion today I took about a five minute walk into the park to legitimize my check in so I could get the "Tree Hugger" badge.  I feel no shame in picking up my badge because  I'm no stranger this park.  I've hiked these trails with my dogs.  I've hiked these trails with my kids as they were growing up.  I've ran trail through here with the Hash House Harriers and peddled my bike through here on numerous occasions. I've even umpired little league baseball games here. This is an awesome park to get away from it all and we as Pittsburghers are luck to have it.  So hey, take a break from your rat race and come hug a tree here sometime.

I feel so fortunate to be employed and working downtown. Hell, I feel very fortunate to be employed! But working in town is awesome. There's a plethora of dining options, it's so convenient to stick around after work for a concert or a play and there's so much free music and art in this city. As for galleries, Space is my favorite.

The exhibits, which change about every two months, usually lean a little on the avant-garde side of the scale but the art is always tasteful and can be thought provoking. I'm amazed more people in this city don't take advantage of all the free culture available to them. I personally love it!

Alright, the reviews do not lie.

I've been to Vegas several times, and like a tourist always have to get those stupid cups with the frozen concoction while walking around.

I've been to several places, several cups, plenty of different drinks, but never went to Fat Tuesdays.. until now.

Believe the hype, if you want to get your tourist on, go here.

You definitely want to start of your Vegas trip right? Get that 190 Octane and an extra shot for only $1 more. I mean how are you going to pass up another shot for only ONE MORE DOLLAR?! Unless your a pussy--cat?

Also keep your cup, just get a refill and you save $2.

I also tried the Mudslide flavor. It's more of a dessert flavor, you definitely need that extra shot in that flavor.

Don't settle for anything else, you can't be walking around being tourist unless you have a Fat Tuesday cup.

There is nothing wrong with this mall. Perhaps the locals who say so much negativity are spoiled because of the much more high class fancy malls on the strip.

But if you come from somewhere else, it will seem like any other mall around your area.

If you are from the Bay Area, you will feel right at home. Think old school Eastridge, or East Bay malls. It's what we're use to and hell probably the mall all the real shoppers go to for a hard to find item. 

Surrounding seems fine. Never felt any kind of threat. But again it's all subjective. 

If you grew up in a predominant white neighborhood with little to no minorities, in the suburbs with home owners association, and don't understand the meaning of "movin' on up", because you were already up there to begin with.... yea you'll hate this mall.

I gave it 3/5 stars because compared to the other malls, yes thats the stars it deserves, but it doesn't mean its one to avoid.

I was hesitant to try this place while in Vegas, because I figured I could have a burger anywhere. Well, I still ended up here and I'm glad I did. Fukuburger was definitely good.

What makes FUKUBURGER unique is the Asian inspired combinations in the burgers. It makes it different--but in a good way. Only of course if your palette is open to new things. I guess you wouldn't be a true foodie if it isnt. 

I had the KARAI SPICY BURGER, and let me tell you, it really IS SPICY! It definitely made me sweat. So if you don't plan on sweating while eating, do not order this. BUT if you are a fan of hot and spicy food, this is delicious and a great choice! But you've been warned on the spice/hot level. Again, I wish I didnt eat this with a group of coworkers and friends. Was a bit embarrassing sweating and constantly patting my head with a napkin and drinking soda.

The burger meat itself was delicious too. The other flavors they add on didn't take away from being able to taste the meat. It was cooked perfectly too. I believe the lady taking the order mentions they are all cooked medium? 

Now it can get a bit pricey when you add on fries and a soda. So expect to pay at least around $10 per person. The fries are good too though. They are seasoned and come with some dipping sauces that top it off. 

So definitely worth a shot. Like I said, it's different--but in a good way. Not the usual burger. Some may not like it, and that's fine. But if you are open to try new things and fusion of flavors, give this place a shot. I couldn't give it a perfect score simply because it seems a little pricey.

This is a big case of, "You always want more what you can't have"

This always hold true to us West Coast folks. Especially after Harold & Kumar took a wonderful journey just to go to one of these White Castles.

Let's get down and dirty. In & Out still reigns supreme for fast food burger joints. It beats this by miles! It also beats the East Coast's Shake Shack if you look at it as a whole in terms of value/quality etc. Where Shake Shack actually serves up good quality food, despite a higher price than In & Out (In & Out serves good quality food at a great price--thus why it's hard to beat), White Castle on the other hand tastes as good as it looks--and go look at the pictures.

The burgers are tiny, and thus why they serve them in multiples when you order a combo. Usually 4 or 6 etc. They are served in those signature boxes. We just got the cheeseburgers for our first time experience. The food is a BIG BIG "MEHHHH". 

Nothing special at all. Like I said, taste as good as it looks, and it's not much to look at. 

This location is located inside the Casino Royale. It has it's own entrance from outside the strip, but it is not an isolated space of it's own. Once you go inside you will see the casino floor on the right. So if you were hoping to not be exposed to smoke, think again. The staff all seemed great though, despite being hectic opening week.

I'm just glad I got it out of the way and was able to say I've tried it.

No matter what Boiling Crab & Hot and Juicy will always be compared to each other! Their menus & concepts are practically identical yet the 2 are quite different~ 

Atmosphere: I prefer BC! The restaurant is huge with plenty of TVs and I love how you can tag up their walls ~

Service: BC wins! Their servers are always smiley & happy! I love how they put your bibs on for you~

Quality: I think it's a tie! Both places have always had fresh seafood! Yummmmmy! And they usually have the same prices~ 

Corn/Potatoes/Sausage: For some reason they taste better at BC.. they just do! 

Special Sauce: I prefer the Hot & Juicy special sauce over the whole shabang! It has a stronger deeper flavor and you can definitely taste the garlic! BC can sometimes be way too salty for me..

Overall, The Boiling Crab wins but not by that much! I still like to eat at both places ~

I think Red Rock Lanes is the nicest local bowling spot! It's very clean and even kind of trendy looking haha I feel like they have less lanes than the South Point bowling alley but they also have a "VIP" area where you can host private bowling parties! There are plenty of flat screens and plenty of seats for your cheerleaders to cheer you on from and they are located right by the parking garage (park in the garage by the far right elevator) so you don't have to walk through the casino to get there! They have lots of rules but they are not strictly enforced so that's nice! Like most bowling alleys they have an arcade, bowling shop & snack bar (we didn't sample any food) & a fun bar area! I really liked their bar area because they had pool tables, shuffle boards, dart boards and video poker. They also have 2 sets of restrooms on each end of the bowling alley so you don't have to walk too far. The cashiers and all of the staff were friendly for the most part...

I would give RRL 4 stars but I feel the bartender, Steve, just really wasn't that nice. There were about 15+ of us so maybe he was overwhelmed since he was working alone but it just seemed like he was trying to upsell on everything.. I asked him if there were any drink specials and he said no so I mentioned the big poster up front with the "After Dark" specials and he was just like "ohhh you mean those..." So my friend ordered a $2 domestic draft special and he tried to talk her out of it saying it's too small... I tried ordering a $3 cranberry vodka and he said that it was going to be very weak.. WTF why have the damn specials if you're going to be a beyotchhhh about them!?!?!?! HAHA So I ended up getting a $9 cranberry vodka instead which really wasn't even that strong! Pitchers of Bud light are decently priced at $9. Any who... the bartenders at South Point bowling alley are way friendlier and make the drinks much stronger!   



HOT TIP:

After Dark Specials (Sun-Thurs:) $1.50 games; $2 domestic drafts; $3 well drinks!!!
Cosmic bowling: Fridays 6pm - 2am $4.95 & Saturdays 6pm - 2am $4.95

Open 7 days a week.
Monday - Thursday: 8am - 2am
Friday: 8am - (no closure)
Saturday: 24 hours - (no closure)

Oh Brio's HAPPY HOUR is probably one of my top HH places! You can not beat their $3.95 appetizers and $5 drinks! Well actually before their apps were only $2.95 but hey it's only a $1 increase.. I can handle that! Haha my must haves when I go are the beef carpaccio & spinach artichoke dip! My man and I usually share the burger as well.. The sucky part about this place would be that you can never tell if you're going to be able to get a spot or not.. The best place to sit is inside in one of the booths or outside by the firepit if you have a big group but it can get pretty busy.  Another negative thing is that sometimes there are lots of pigeons out on the patio... Boo! But hey what can you do..!?

I come here often for oil changes.. And their waiting area is awesome! Free donuts, pastries, bagels, etc.. I love their cappuccino machine & mini fridge stocked with "Lexus water" lol & soda... They have a nice big flat screen and many magazines to look through as well has a separate children's room ;]]] Their restrooms are nice and they even have some computers available to use~!!!

Their oil changes used to be only $50 but the last time i went it was like $69.95... so boooooo~!!!

They have a nice beer list and serve them in frozen mugs - they really hit the spot. Also the fries are to die for.

In the spirit of Don King, I'll have to put up two heavyweight contenders:

Pho Saigon 8 "I 8 pho" vs. Pho So 1 "yea so, we #1"

This is a lot like Ken vs. Ryu (Street Fighter!)... if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, than you missed out on an era of video games, and my set-up for the review was wasted because than I can't explain it to you terms of Kens flaming dragon punch vs. Ryu's flaming fireball. If you do know Street Fighter, than you'd know that I'm trying to say is that I think both restaurants are almost comparable to each other.

This is how I see how each breaks down - I order "Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet":

Pho So 1 -
PRO'S:
. This is typically the place I normally go to when I'm hungover like I normally am in Vegas. Pho does a body good after drinks.
. It's clean, it's nicer looking than most Pho restaurants, and it's usually packed...most often with some hotties.
. They have an extensive menu
. huge parking lot
. Catch up on finding a real estate agent because they advertise in the menu.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants I've been too.
CON'S:
. Mediocre pho broth. Can sometimes taste like beef broth in a can. The 99.8% fat free kind. Come on! Fat is flavor!
. Service??
. Get distracted by look'n at the menu cuz a bunch of real estate agents advertise in the menu.

Pho Saigon 8
PRO'S
. Pho broth is slightly better than So #1
. Won numerous awards in several publications for best Pho/Vietnamese restaurant.
. My friend "Double D" says this is her favorite place, and she's a local.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants.
. The #8 is a goodluck number to Asians. Esp, Asians who gamble.
CON'S
. Smaller parking lot
. The day we went they forgot about our drink order.
. Older and less appealing interior
. $7 freak'n dollars for a LARGE bowl which isn't any bigger than So #1's large bowl of Pho. In fact, I think it's slightly smaller.
. My boba in my Thai Ice tea was like rubber pellets.
. It's located further west on Spring Mountain than So #1

It's almost a toss up, but I'd have to give it up to Pho So #1 mainly because it's more convenient, and it's a slightly better value than #8 regardless of taste.

I chop yo chicken!!! I chop yo chicken into small chunks. I don't mince yo chicken.... I just chop into tiny juicy pieces. This is the reason why the egg drop soup with minced chicken didn't suck. Unlike Most restaurants which tend to abuse their chicken (Capitol Seafood), Joyful did chicken right like your gams gams making homemade chicken soup. But not everybody is your gam gams, and most tend to abuse their chicken because chicken is so lean it leads to dry bland chicken bits that you will choke on (I just wanted to put "choke" and "chicken" in the same sentence).

The spicy and probably sour shrimp was decent, but not stellar although they did do a stand-up job on prepping those on-yerns (onions) which was sliced thinly - most Chinese restaurants will just quarter the onions.... slackers!

Also ordered the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot vegetable dish. Nothing like your leafy green vegetables to keep you "regular"... this might be good for you, if you're one of those people that disappear for an hour or so with a magazine under your arm. FYI - I'm in'n'out in record time... the secret is "leafy greens".

The last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinctive flavor. That's why I'll generically just say it was "decent".

The reason why I tried this place out, is because I can't stand getting screwed with all the high priced, hyped up crap on the strip. Instead, I like my "crap" off the strip.... speaking of crap, those leafy greens I had earlier is working their magic.

$15/mo for unlimited car-washes?  in hawaii, we'd pay an arm and a leg for that.
i don't know about other stations here, but the carwash deal they have is awesome in my opinion. the car wash procedure is so easy like a, b, c.. you just drive up to the guy at the window, he meets you on the other side to scrub your car a little and you drive right through.   it's quick, convenient and the best part is that you can go as much as you want to, like daily.  i give the wash itself 3.5 stars because it doesn't dry too well.

Stopped at this shop as part of the Chocolate Tour of Edinburgh. It's a fab mix between an authentic wee sweetie shop, a gallery and a gift shop. The lady in the shop was very knowledgable about her stock. She was able to match people with their local sweets and talk a lot about the changes sweets have gone through over the years (no more cocaine on our sweeties!!). 

The gallery/gift shop area was a nice little browse too. 

The shop is very small so our group of 10 was a bit squashed when some other shoppers arrived. 

The shop is dog friendly and had some water and food outside for any visiting pooches!

Excellent private dining experience. If you get dessert, go for the toffee pudding (Sooo great!).  Menu was great and good was delicious.   Atmosphere was even better.  Service was lacking, hence the four and not five stars.  Three problems:  

1. I was part of a large group and I asked the server to change my order before he put in the ticket for the table.  The server was openly aggravated at my request.  I didn't like that.  

2. The duck/gnocchi dish did not actually have any gnocchi in it.  It came with roasted veggies instead so that was a surprise.  Still delicious, but was not as advertised.  We received no prior warning from the server that gnocchi was not part of the dish.  

3.  I ordered my fillet medium rare and it was served medium well.  I didn't touch it.  The server had nothing to say about it.

Where to begin? 

My hubby and I were going to get married on 11/11/11, but after trying to plan it and not being able to find a venue, we decided to just elope on Valentine's day and be the first couple in Vegas married on that legendary wedding day.

My husband's birth mom was getting m,arried at this chapel i a few months and referred us, and while they were very accomidating in coming in at 11pm and staying til' 1am, I was disappointed with a few things. 

First, the chapel is quite lovely. we looked at other chapels all day before the wedding and they made me want to take a rape shower with a brillo pad afterwards. Belleza has a lovely and clean chapel and dressing room.  

I knew we werent allowed to take photos or video, that was fine. My issue was with the photos they took. I am heavy set and asked the photographer to please shoot me at certain angles and be minful of my weight and face angles. he assured me he would, however he had an absessed tooth that night and the camera was often crooked. 

i asked for a civil service, nothing religious. the minister was pissed. I asked for vows that were "short and sweet and void of any religeous wording." he said I could have short or sweet, not both. witjough the mention of god I apparently left him with nothing to say. 

after it was all done, MY ENTIRE party andb guests are pulled in a room to look at my pics. I was appalled and cried. i looked so bloated and he didnt listen to a damned thing i said. i cried and cried and asked them to be taken off the screen so i could try to choose my photos in private later. 

the next day Kay said she felt really bad so she was going to "cut me a deal" on the photos so taht I could take them all to get retouched. I paid the extra money and walked away...


Momths later my husbands moether tells me that Kay slipped her a copy of my wedding photos for FREE on here wedding day and that I wasnt supposed to know. I FLIPPED out. I HATED those photos and was so pissed. I asked for a refund on the extra $300  had to pay for shitty pics and an appology and got neither.

NEVE GO HERE!!!!!! go to a casino chapel...

I stopped by the Term A club on my way to SEA. As always I was cheerfully welcomed into the club and asked if there was anything they could do to help.

First stop the loo. I walked past the 2 gentlemen in the hall into a closet sized mens room. Both facilities are fully occupied so know I understand why they were standing outside the door. Hey AA having a men's room equipped with one urinal and one stall is not very customer friendly.. C'mon a small expansion in capacity would eliminate gentlemen queuing up in the hallway. So instead of waiting in the hall I decided a Bloody Mary would be in order. Don't judge me I've been up since 330AM and it's noon somewhere east of AZ.

Approaching the empty bar I politely asked for a bloody Mary I barely got an acknowledgment from the bartender, Jorge. I was handed my drink said thank you and received squat for a response. No he was not busy .  I asked Jorge to change a $5 and provide me with $3 change. He handed me my change without even acknowledging the tip. Hey Jorge how about a simple thank you!! I could have left you  a $0 tip for a Comped beverage. If you don't like being in the service industry get out or change your attitude.

Let's see a star for the gals upfront and a star for the nice breakfast spread.

I went here about 2 weeks ago after hitting up Life. This place has a large selection of breakfast food. I liked the signs and the burger was good as well. The waiter told us they were getting new menus but based on the other news it looks like it closed down instead. That is a shame i would come here again if the situation presented itself.

Before my favorite churrascaria opened, I used to go here. Although it's cheaper here and they're open for lunch everyday and they have goat cheese at the salad bar, the service and food quality is marginal. 

They have the usual Brazilian BBQ salad bar items such as smoked salmon, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, cheeses, olives, salami, beans and rice etc. They give you pao de queijo, fried bananas and mashed potatoes. The meats include chicken, beef, pork, sausage and lamb. I've tried their Key Lime pie, cheesecake, flan and chocolate mousse all of which were just ok.

The gaucho guys seem to take longer going around and when I come to a churrascaria, I come famished...waiting cannot happen. They seem careless too. I'd have blood/ oil/ meat juice drip next to my plate or my arm! Obrigadinha!

Out of the churrascaria's in Vegas. FdC on Flamingo is #1 on my list, TdB is #2, VB in Summerlin is #3...and that P place in Planet Hollywood? Forget it!

Located on the same floor as the lingerie section. After shopping and you want a bite to eat, here's good option for you. Look around for the food display, figure out what you want, grab a drink, a tray, place your order, grab your number and pay at the end of the line.

Skirt Steak:
Comes with asparagus, carrots, potatoes and chimichurri. Get it medium rare or rare since this is a thin piece of meat, otherwise, you'll be gnawing on beef jerky. For $15, you get a pretty nice meal. 5/5

Parmesan-crusted Chicken Salad:
Not the healthiest salad on their menu and it's not the best one either. 3/5

Nicoise Salad with Salmon:
Greens, onions, green beans, hard boiled egg slices, potaoes and salmon. This is what I normally get from here but I never learn my lesson of asking not to put onions, olives and egg yolks. I actually spend time removing these things rom my salad. 4.5/5

Roasted Salmon:
Comes with zucchini, carrots, potatoes and corn. I got extra carrots instead of zucchini. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The veggies were roasted and seasoned. The corn was a bit salty though so, I didn't eat the whole thing. Saved me from having corn stuck in between my teeth. 4/5

I am a frequent visitor to Las Vegas (about once a month).  It's not that I am a big gambler, but combined gambling (using my player's card) from my family has allowed me to get free comps here at The Venetian and all of Harrahs' Hotels (Caesar's, Paris, Rio, Flamingo, Bally's, and Harrahs').  If you visit Vegas often, you must get a player's card.  Money played at the slots do get more 'points' than table games. You will receive discounted hotel rate and promotional events (which often include free hotel stay).  Of course, the more you play, the more promo/discount you get.  I have not had to pay for any hotel stay in the last 4 years.  

The staffs at The Venetian are very polite.  However, there were a few times I got there around midnight (left after work on Friday) and got a handicap room or 'back-up' room (often on the 3rd or 4th floor of the Venetian Suite which is kind of run-down and I hate it.  This is why I am giving 4-star and not 5) because they were completely sold out.  I don't understand because I had reservation.  There were still people at the check in line.  I asked if everyone still in line was going to get the 'backup room' , and the counter girl said 'Yes'.  I find that hard to believe.  I can only imagine I got the backup room because it was comp!!!  They do manage to switch me the next day but it was a big inconvenience and made the whole experience less pleasant.  After 3 trips like this, I knew better to check in earlier.  

I like The Venetian because each room is a suite with a sunken living room.  A room with king canopy-draped bed is about 650 sq. ft., and with 2 queens is about 700 sq. ft.  They used to have a sofa sleeper which is a full size, so it could accommodate up to 6 people in a room.  They have begun renovating their suites now and replaced the sofa bed with modern sofa and plasma TV's (3 TV's, one for bedroom side, one for the living room side, and one in the bathroom!).  So 5 people is the max for the room now.  But keep in mind, their policy is 4 people per room, so be discreet about it if there are more than 4 of you staying in the same room.  The marble bathroom is equipped with 2 sinks, a bathtub with separate shower room, and a vanity table with mirror and bench.  

I've stayed at both the Venetian Suite and Venezia Suite.  Venesia is a newer tower with more modern decor.  But like I said, they are renovating so more modern furnitures are replacing the older rooms.  I prefer to stay at the Venetian Suite because it's closer to the casino and easier to get in and out.  They are adding a new tower to the hotel.  Supposedly it's for the high rollers.   

There are many restaurants to choose from and the Grand Canal Shops offer just about any name brand you ever could want.  If you are in a romantic mood, hop on one of those gondola rides and enjoy a little Venice.  It's indoor, but they painted the ceilings with floating sky with clouds so it feels like day time outdoor.  I am sure it's designed to keep you there 24/7.  

The Tao night club is crazy.  I see lines out the door all the time.  I am not a club-goer so I wouldn't know how it is.  I'd think it's probably pretty nice to attract so many people all the time.  What I have observed is that through the years, the patrons seem to get younger and younger.  I don't know where they get the money to stay here or play here, but they got the money!   

The hotel is beautiful, rated AAA 5-diamond, so even if you don't stay here, I'd still recommend you come visit.  I love Vegas because you get to experience the best in life.  Some of the best shows, best restaurants, and best hotels are all here in your reach!!!

I have come to the conclusion that not one single restaurant in Paris Hotel Casino Resort is edible.  Not the cafe(s), nor the buffet, and now add Mon Ami Gabi to the list.  

I've been staying at this hotel/casino for 5 days (Thanks for the Comp Red Room, Paris!).  Our last night here so I thought I'd give this place a try.  I was hugely disappointed at my meal.  We were seated in the 'Atrium Room' with direct view of Bellagio Fountain.  Yes, it was nice but I came here for the food.  There is a door opened out to the outdoor seating area and the constant chill wind which cools the food very fast was not 'cool'.  

The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (celery root remoulade, gribiche sauce) was really average.  I'm glad it was grilled and not deep fried. 

The Butter Lettuce & Honey Apple Crisp Salad (roasted beets, aged goat cheese, apple cider vinaigrette)  was also forgettable.  I could barely taste the dressing.  

The Roast Chicken & Frites ( all-natural roasted half chicken, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions) - oh pleeeaaasssee!  Costco's Rotisserie chicken had more flavor than this.  It was dry and tasteless!

The Filet Mignon (merlot butter, red wine reduction) which is their signature dish and you would think it should stand out!  First of all, I ordered it medium and it came as medium rare.  The sauce was supposed to be merlot butter but it was so bland that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it.  But after about 3 bites, I had to trade it with my fiance for his Roast Chicken which was even worse!  

And those FRITES, what the hell were those?  String potato chips?  You could have served it with FRENCH fries and that would have been better.  

Service was friendly but I wouldn't say it was attentive.  The waiter was more interested in talking to his fellow servers than to his guests.  

It's food like this that reminds me of why I don't care for French restaurants!

Starbucks is pretty much the McDonald's of coffee.  Not cheap but you know you will get the same thing the same way at every single location.  The coffee is good, I like the dessert element they make coffee into.  The food is ok and you can usually count on it being consistent and fresh.  The writing of your name on the cup in TOTALLY obtuse and weird phonetic fashion has got to be something they either train them for or look for that quality when they are hiring.  The staff is not ignorant and they are always pleasant and courteous.  I love the new Cool Refreshers to take to yoga!  Yum.  I also like the new app they have which makes the whole ordering, paying and tipping process cashless.  That makes it convenient and make a me more likely to search out a Starbucks.

This is a consistently decent burger chain.  It is a little in the pricey side but you leave full.  I love the Shroom burger with Swiss cheese with the endless sweet potato fries.  A nice large burger smothered with mushrooms and melty cheese.  A little pink for a burger ordered medium but nothing to complain about.  The hubby had some BBQ burger which was huge and the daughter had a guacamole bacon burger.  Those were ample sized burgers and they got endless potato fries.  I had a seasonal cocktail which was good - gingerbread and whiskey.  The others had peach and pomegranate teas which the waitress kept refilled.  Interesting point of sale in the table where you can order items and the server brings them.  You can also pay with that.  Kind of nice.

Now, I've eaten at some great Mediterranean joints. Some fancy, some hole in the wall. But this place takes the cake (or Baklava if you have it).

Two things make this place truly awesome (which is the basic expectation from places you go to eat) - the food and the people. It might be a small 'fast food' shop in the basement of a corporate tower, but boy the food is good. They probably have the most perfectly cooked, juicy chicken I have ever eaten at a place where I have to struggle to push my meal cost to two digits. Add to that the Bulgar rice, side salad and a plethora of traditional sides and veges, and you have meal that will blow you away (and make it hard to finish). The sauces (especially the home-made hot sauce - which 
I think is made fresh everyday) also are an excellent addition to the meal.

The place is run by a family, and you are fed like you are part of the family (read it feels like a complete home cooked meal). The owner (Josh) is a wonderful guy - he cares more about you enjoying a satisfying meal, than taking your money for it. Multiple times he has told me to pay later if his CC machine doesn't work, and keeps throwing in free stuff all the time. 

Yes, this place doesn't have the best ambiance or even table service. Yes, this place has become a bit of a hole in the wall. Yes, this place runs out of food by 12:40 PM on most days. But, if you do manage to make it there on time and get your hands on a box full of delicious, you will leave leave happy and surely come back again.

This place is great for families and large groups. Also great place for quick eats for lunch or dinner  They always have a variety of pizza on the buffet but if you do not see your favorite pizza they will make it for you.  The employees are always friendly and helpful at this location.

Beer, Beer and more Beer! I could care less about wine or spirits.  This place is AWESOME!!!  The craft beer selection is the best in LV.  They have so many different types such as lagers,ales,stouts,weiss and so on that it would take me well over a year to try everyone.   

The store is well organized and clean so it makes it very easy to want to come back.  If you have questions the staff is also very friendly and helpful.  I wish this location was not so far from my home but it might be worth a stop if I am in this part of Spring Valley.  

Oh Yeah! They also care a great selection of wine, many of which have a brief description as to what they are and some even offer food pairing ideas which can be a plus for a novice foodie. 

The Spirits section is also very broad. They have everything that is fermented or distilled, bottled or barreled.   Once in a while they do offer wine sampling's and such.  The prices at Lee's are also very competitive and reasonable, another huge plus.   Great visit at this location.  Thanks for making me a fan.

I LOVE this place!! Smoke is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. They definitely have the best tacos in the Burgh! They just reopened in Lawrenceville & the new place is beautiful. So much more seating available. Everything I've eaten @ Smoke has been delicious. The Queso & chips & the Mac n cheese are definite appetizers. I always order the egg & veggie tacos both with avocado cream. Amazing! This past time I went I tried the Brisket taco & it was so good! Honestly I was a little leery to try the brisket b/c I had just been to Austin TX & tried brisket for the first time (which Texas is known for their smoked brisket). However I must say Smoke did a damn good job making their brisket. Not quite as good as Texas but its still really good!! 
Service is always great, everybody is so friendly. The only downside is once you place your order it takes a long time to get your tacos. But it's totally worth the wait!
Highly recommend!!!

So I ate at Meat & Potatoes for the first time last weekend and honestly I was so disappointed. After reading all the great reviews I had high hopes for this place but I was not impressed at all. 
First off I love the decor and the atmosphere. They really did a great job with that. 
Also the service we had was great. Our waitress was the best. I would say she was probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had at a restaurant. I give her 5 stars. 
But unfortunately the food was just not that great. They have a great idea but just something was missing and not quite all there with each dish. Don't get me wrong the food isn't bad I just don't think it's worth going back for a second time. There's so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh I don't think I'll waste my time eating @ Meat & Potatoes again.
I do have to give props to them for the dessert. We ordered the s'mores dessert which came out in a small cast iron dish that was warm, it was awesome! If you do decide to eat here definitely order the s'mores desert.

I just had to try their Cronuts.  We came right at closing and the lady gave us a 1/2 price deal on the tray of remaining goodness.  The tray had 2 Cronuts, their mega Apple bear claw, Apple fritter and 5 other donuts.   The Cronuts were so light abs flaky.  The icing was really good making them a welcome treat.  The bear claw had tons of Apple filling.   It was more than 1 person could eat, 
   The remaining goodies were also a delight.  So much so we returned a few days later earlier in the day to get more variety.  A great donut shop well worth the drive.

This review is for the dog park only. This park does not accommodate dogs that like to run. It's small. Maybe we've been spoiled with the bigger parks like Vista Paseo and Shawnee. Seems to be the place for an older crowd with smaller dogs. The dogs that are larger seem to just lay around and not play. The biggest dog here is a bully. Barks and growls at any dog that is larger than pint size. 
I wanted to like this place since the view is so beautiful but it's just not our type of crowd. We need fun, energetic, positive dogs and ppl.

Eh.... just average, but really it's how i feel about all Bucca De Bepo's. 
We came to this location for our one year anniversary OnLY because we had a gift card. From my experiences w Bucca i knew the food had much to be desired so I sought the advice from my fellow Yelpers on what to order, maybe there was something i was missing out out on. So i tried the Ceasar salad that someone said was the best they'd ever had, which makes me sad for her. It was far from the best, the lettuce was wilted and soggy. I went on my own for the main dish. I forgot the name of it, but it was a spicy shrimp pasta dish. It was pretty good. My son ordered the fetticcini Alfredo. The sauce was clumpy and lacked flavor. Decided to try the highly recommended tiramisu. I was expecting a slice but got a huge bowl (i know, duh I'm at Bucca). Again it was ok. Nothing to rave about. Then again i doubt anything can beat the tiramisu that i had at an Italian Deli in San Fran. 
Overall... service and food was, like i said, eh.

Super fun spot! My son always asks if we can go when we are in AZ. We really need one of these in Vegas. Its a chill spot to go with family, have a fun night out with friends or just by yourself to hit some balls, major stress reliever. The atmosphere is fun and exciting, lots going on.  Been here a few times and always left very happy!

Unfortunately, this last visit our service was short of horrible. We sat at the bay for almost 15 min before I finally tracked down someone and asked for our server. What made it even worse was the table right next to us (5 males) had been checked on by same female server 3 times (when we started counting) without even acknowledging us, imagine our surprise when we realized that same female server was the one who ended up attending to us before passing us off to yet another server (who BTW was actually really great).

Nellis is a bit of a hike for me, I rarely come here,just for doctor appointments and to visit with friends.

This base however is pretty good, the A&FRC offers support for not only just deployed airmen but to unaccompanied tours as well, which was a big help to me! 

The BX here is really nice, I wish they'd ID more people though, there were a LOT of people that should have not been using the BX, but whatever. I like the furniture store, but in true AAFEES fashion, its over priced and 100$ for delivery. 

The Commisarry is great, if I didn't live closer to Creech, I would shop here more often, maybe as gas prices continue to drop, I'll shop here more often. Great prices for meat and produce. I wish they'd limit the coupons here, these coupon hoarders come through here to clear out shelves.

All in all, this base is one of the better assignments we've had, hopefully more is come!

This place is AMAZING! The staff is very friendly, the decor is very sporty NY sports. The menu was full and had SO many choices. The staff was beyond great, worked well as a team and made sure everyone's cups where filled, food was great.

We got garlic knots on the house, so good! The cheese pizza was great, crispy and a nice crunchy crust. The meat lovers and hawaiian wasn't as crispy but it was weighed down from toppings. They only used the best toppings, you can taste the quality.  The desserts looked fantastic, I wish I had more room to try them! 

The kids meal was awesome, my son was beyond excited for a pizza slice bigger than his head! 

So we got 2 slices of pizza, a drink, a kids meal, a hot pastrami and a slice of pizza for less than 25$ 

We'll never go back to eating papa johns, dominos or pizza hut again! 

** I wouldn't come here in a LARGE group, it's a small dining area.

Also as usual, the side dishes for one of the guests in my party didn't come out until after THREE requests for them...and probably 15 minutes after chicken & waffles came out. 

The waffles were underdone. 

Finally, as usual, the service was spotty.

I love Chipotle. This location, though not as good as the one on Camelback, for whatever reason, is still great.
The food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic.
Chipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic. 
Although the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil.
No matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly.

Postino is great little wine bar. The food is great and so is the wine.
Everything is made fresh and the wine selection is seasonal. Some of my favorite wine(s) I have discovered hear. And you can't go wrong with the bruschetta.
The reason I am not rating it higher is the parking. For whatever reason they have valet parking now, maybe because the place has become so trendy. But it is a pain in the arse to get to now and getting a little pretentious.
It is still a great little place, though, to meet for wine and great food.

This place is heaven, the Valhalla of alcohol. Tons and tons of choices, beer, wine, Scotch, Cognac, Whiskey and Bourbon, Vodka, Tequila and lots of other things you or I have probably never seen or heard of, like the Danish alcohol with Cocoa leaves.
18 year old Jameson? Georgia moonshine? $20 six pack of beer? Icelandic Vodka? Ouzo? Cigars? Cheese? Olive juice for martinis? They have it all. Nearly every country and every spirit is represented here. You will be hard pressed to not find what you are looking for, in fact, you will find more.
Depending on what you buy, the prices are great. There is a reason BevMo is popping up all over the valley.

They have cool clothes by local and hip vendors, like RVCA. They have tshirts, jackets, hats, dresses, jewelry, all things that you won't come across just anywhere. That is the great thing, it is independent and not your run of the mill clothing store, the stuff is actually cool. Not to mention is a locally owned.
The prices are high, but hey, it is stuff you won't find just anywhere and I don't feel bad about supporting a local business that is part of a great cultural change in downtown.

Even though I prefer the Ray/101 location (it's three times bigger than Tempe's!), I do most of my WF shopping here as it is much closer to my house.  I know that this location will be moving even further away to the Mosaic condominium site (oh, how I wished I could live there... will it even come to fruition in today's economy?).  It will be a sad day for me when Whole Foods Tempe moves further away from me...

I love the curry chicken salad found in the deli dept!!  it neither contains **, so I'm able to consume it w/o negative effects :D  I also love the gourmet ice creams and gelatos sold here.  There are at least two new labels offered, and I recommend both: McConnell's Ice Cream (Brazilian coffee!!), and Mashti Malone's Rose-Scented Ice creams (Rose-scented Saffron w/ Pistachios).  Mashti's version is good, but not as great as the homemade version sold at Tasty Kabob's (understandably, since I would think "homemade" would also mean less chances of commercial preservatives used, but sometimes this isn't the case; in any case, Mom and I both noticed that MM's version isn't as good, but I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more in the future!!)

I should also note that Ciao Bella's gelatos are pretty good, even though they contain corn syrup :(  I enjoyed a new flavor- malted chocolate milk balls, but the two I really favored on my last visit were Mocha Chip and Dulce de Leche... ooh, life can be so sweet!!

In the sprouted grain bread aisle- do check out the sprouted onion and poppy seed bagels!!  Don't forget to check the nutrition label- each bagel contains 320 calories (!!), but it also contains 2 g of fiber (regular white flour bagels contain 0 fiber).  I like Ezekiel sprouted grain loaves (but not the "lower sodium" kind- no flavor at all).  Each slice only contains 80 calories and is loaded w/ 3 g fiber!!  I enjoy it w/ Lily's peanut butter (Filipino-brand pb that can be found at Lee Lee supermarket on Warner/Dobson... Filipinos tend to favor sweeter foods, and this pb is definitely sweeter than your average pb.  It also contains a slightly higher saturated fat content, 1.5 g more than your average all-natural pb, though it is from peanut oil, so the higher fiber bread helps to counteract this!).

I thought I'd update my reviews here by mentioning that there will be an ice cream social event on Saturday, July 27th, from 2p to 5p, or so an e-newsletter informed me this morning!  I clicked on the Facebook link http://wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/youre-cordially-invited-ice-cream-social-july-27?sf15241907=1 to get more information, which led me to a WF website link that stated "all Whole Foods" will be participating.  I wish I could go, because not only will WF have their own brand of ice cream on-hand, but one of my favorite organic brands, Three Twins, is going to be featured, and both email and website state that for every Three Twins purchase made, one dollar will be donated to the Non-GMO Project!  To find out more this organization, please visit http://nongmoproject.com.

The website mentioned all WF stores are participating, but that "some stores might have sweet concoctions up their sleeve like sundaes, shakes, floats and malts and many are planning fun events for kids and adults alike..."  

Wish I could attend the event myself, but I'll be at work, so for those of you planning to attend, just have an extra tablespoon of ice cream for me!  :)

Tried to find out if a few pastries contained corn syrup, cornstarch, or powdered sugar in the chocolate glazes and cream fillings, but the woman wearing a baker's coat didn't know which ones did, and which ones didn't.  She just looked at the pastries I pointed out with a blank stare and said "It's hard to tell which ones do and which ones don't."  Did she tell me to call so and so in the morning to find out?  Nope.

Prices seem very high compared to the sizing of the pastries.   I don't mind paying for quality ingredients, but if the "baker" on duty can't answer a few questions, then I'll find another bakery with staff who can!

p.s.  A younger woman, who was assisting a customer looking into a book of cake designs, asked the woman I had just questioned earlier if they could do an almond cake filling, so it would seem that the woman does some baking here.  I thought perhaps I'd just asked someone tending the register who didn't know anything about the products they sold here...  I'm off to find pastries elsewhere!

Stopped by tonight after having dinner at a pizzeria nearby.  Never been, but had prepared myself to expect a smaller location compared to that at Ray Rd. and the 101 (my fave!).  Was surprised to notice an unpleasant smell (akin to what Asian supermarkets tend to smell like with their stocks of rice and the odors that emanate from their meat shops) just as I entered the market, which continued as I entered the produce department.  

This place is small!  The "olive bar" consisted of maybe 8 (max) containers the size of small bread loaves.  Pathetic, but what can you expect from a converted Wild Oats?  The selection of meats looked fresh, though (beef top loin is on sale at $5.99/lb., while center-cut pork chops are $2.99/lb!).  While the cheese counter is small, it did showcase fresh-looking items, and the whole store, in general, looked clean and was brightly-lit.  I couldn't find my favorite Wellshire bacon (peppered uncured), but I was able to find the only tasty whole-grain whole wheat bread I can enjoy w/o pain (Natural Bread Co.'s Honey Whole Wheat), albeit there was only one loaf available to buy!  And I quickly had a glimpse of their bulk section... Thank God I was full, or I'd have stopped for some sweets!

In a pinch, I'd stop here for emergency re-stocking, but I'll probably head over to the Tatum/Shea or Mayo locations (both of which I haven't visited, yet!) to get my dining-at-Whole Foods fix!

Is it me, or do prices at CVS usually run lower than Walgreen's?  I suppose the two are just like every other competing company out there, raising the prices on certain items while lowering prices on others to make it look like they're offering a sale that day...

Last time I visited a CVS location (not this one), I couldn't find what I was searching for.  (Funny enough, I found the items at a Walgreen's closer to home.)  At THIS particular location, I fell for an advertising gimmick that, on quick glance (I only had a couple of minutes to spare), looked like I was saving on a travel-sized toothpaste, but it turned out that the "savings" would apply on my NEXT trip, providing I visit before the coupon's expiration date, on the same product.  I keep hearing that signing up for a CVS loyalty card pays, but I've yet to believe it!

Student dentists are caring and compassionate and eager to do their best.  They are also humble and smart enough to ask for help when they need it.

NOTE: I'm biased because I'm a student dentist here.

The faculty here is amazing.

If you have lots of time and not as much money, this is a good option for you.  

Upsides of being a patient here: you have multiple eyes looking so you know you're getting the best of care and it's less expensive than going to a private office.

Downsides of being a patient here: appointments can take up to 3.5 hours long each time and there is a long process to things because it is a teaching clinic.

Great dim sum!  Go on Sunday for brunch/lunch!

Favorites that I always order:
Shrimp dumplings
Bean curd rolls
Shrimp or beef noodle wraps
Snow buns for dessert

If you're brave, try the chicken feet.  It's a traditional plate that is delicious as long as you can get over the fact that you're eating feet.  If you're Asian, you should have been born over it.  haha

Drink tea with your dim sum!  It's not right any other way.

The owner/manager comes around during dim sum time to make sure you got all the goodies you wanted.  If not, he goes and grabs it from the cart especially for you!  How nice of him!

I've been here for dim sum, with one occasion for dinner.  Everything was tasty!  There aren't as many traditional choices that would be found in the bay area or LA (California), but this is the best place in the Pheonix/Mesa area for Chinese food so far.

Tacos El Gordo is the only authentic Mexican food shop I would recommend in Vegas. The meat is sliced right in front of you and you can get all the extras (like pineapple) for free.
Each line is for a different type of meat. Make sure to read the signs! I hate being in restaurants where I don't understand the menu/how to order/what to order. Tacos El Gordo is exactly that, so bring a friend that knows what they're doing! The tacos are small-- 10 tacos for a guy is a good start.

Japanese crepes are better than French crepes!
If you've ever been to Japan, you've seen the small crepe stands that occupy every mall, festival and street corner. Japanese crepes are made with icecream, fruit and whipped cream. No veggies and meat!!!! Crepe shack and waffles serve only Japanese style dessert crepes. 
The second you open the door the sweet smell of crepes will hit you. There are a ton of board games for you to play and the restaurant is large enough that you can spend a good chunk of time there without other customers giving you the stink eye to leave so they can sit. 
Choose your crepe flavor and then choose your icecream (Thriftys!) 
My favorite is the Rebel Special with butter pecan icecream. 

They are really big on you eating crepes the "proper" way and thus don't have spoons out for you to use. Ask one of the guys behind the counter and they'll give you one :) 
Cute, cute date spot! 
There's a Trader Joes next door :)

I swung by Olive or Twist on a friend's recommendation. I was looking for some small bar bites and a brew. I went with the caprese salad which was served with Cous Cous - an interesting addition that I have personally never had before. I enjoyed it because the salad was a bit more filling with that extra shot of protein. It also provided a bit of texture that I enjoyed. The balsamic glaze was de-friggin-licious! I'd recommend venturing upstairs to hang in a big open space with a lot of comfortable seating options. Olive or Twist won't likely blow you away from a food perspective, but they will deliver on cocktails, good atmosphere, and a pretty damn good caprese salad.

Seviche offers a warm atmosphere in the cultural district of Pitt. Flying solo as a biz traveler I immediately went to the bar where the lady bartenders were ferociously whipping up cocktails, pouring Mexican beers, and dashing sangria. These ladies were working hard and with a smile on their face.

Make sure you check yelp when walking in because I checked in for a free sangria which was good (for the price). Then I ordered salmon seviche - fire and ice - this was an interesting combo which combined an icy topping mixed with warmth from peppers. The serving style was unique as there were individual servings in spoons - hard to tell the total portion, but i made a conscious effort to take my time and savor each one.

If texture and contrasting flavors are your thing then definitely go with the fire and ice. It was very good and the bar crowd is friendly. Post up and make some new friends - maybe share a little seviche and stories.

Staying on 6th and Grant, I was looking to explore the city a bit and find some local grub with good beer options. Mercato is just that. 

I strolled in as an obvious biz traveler - I think my branded polo blew my cover - and posted up at the bar. The atmosphere in here is a bit classy but the bar also gives off an inviting, more casual vibe. As soon as I bellied up, I asked for the Love Nitro Stout - I prefer Left Hand's over this one, but it was pretty good nonetheless. 

My meal started with the rocket salad - arugula, almonds, tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. The almonds add great texture and the mozz tasted fresh. Next, I got the vegetarian meatballs- yea that's a thing. Mushrooms, white beans, and cauliflower make up the mixture and it is goooood. I made my serving a panini with the almond, spinach pesto - wow! Finally I got ice cream for dessert. If they have black raspberry then I totally just made your decision for you.

Andrew at the bar was friendly and indulged me in a local culture lesson - sports, food, neighborhoods, districts, etc. If you're looking for laid back, casual, and sarcastic conversation then he's your dude. 

Come here with plenty of time to spare - not an "in and out" kind of place. Hope you enjoy it!

It's just alright.  No bells or whistles.  I haven't stayed here in years, and since then they've remodeled.  But the pub doesn't brew their own beer anymore!  Boo!  Nice that it still has a tram that connects you to Aria, Crystals and Bellagio.  Convenient, but wish it covered the whole end of this side of the strip.  Summer at the check in desk was great- got us a view and printed my gaming cards for us.

Funky looking place- huge!  Liked it right away, even from the parking lot.  Friday night when we arrived, crowded and a long wait- about 40 minutes.  We ordered appetizers- the rolled ones with BRISKET in them!  Perfect with a cold Blue Moon beer.  Finally, got a table and a cool waiter who brought us warm cornbread- great start!  We ordered baby back ribs, catfish, fried chicken with baked potato, coleslaw (with pecans!) and, my favorite, the creamy mac & cheese.  Fantastic find.  Only wish we'd had room for the cobbler of the day!

One of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas before!!!!!! This restaurant is not on the strip inside some fancy shmancy hotel, it's a bit off the strip pass Wynn but not far at all. We walked from our hotel (treasure island) and it took around 20-25 minutes. It is a restaurant inside of an hotel and once you walk into the hotel lobby the restaurant is to the left. Walking into the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess right away and they bought the three of us to a booth inside. It was a very simple yet elegant restaurant. They have a display of wine in glass cases and it was beautiful. 

Before coming to the restaurant we did our research (ie yelped all the pictures, read some reviews and tips, and memorize the menu) so before the server ask if we had any question we already had a good idea about what we were gonna order. Of course we still asked for recommendations especially with the drinks because that's one menu we did not memorize. After ordering drinks for the table they bought over some bread and butter. The bread was so good...I don't know if we were famished from a day of clubbing but it was so good but I had to control myself so I can fit in all the other food. 

For appetizer we ordered the seared foie gras to share! GET IT!!! Shoot you should get two of it! It was perfectly seared and the bread that it came with made the perfect combination. For entree my friend got the Chilean sea bass and I got the steak with my other friend and we shared the Mac and cheese as a side. ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE! It has the perfect crunch on top of some gooey cheese giving you a crunch with each bite. My steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked just the way I like it. My friends Chilean sea bass was also amazing, very fresh and the miso glaze was just right, not too heavy or light. 

Next time you're in Vegas give this place a shot, the prices are fairly cheaper compared to all those other fancy restaurant on the strips and you get an amazing meal with wonderful accommodating servers.

Review is for the eCortez CABANA SUITES...
The best hotel I've ever stayed in for under $100! My boyfriend and I were attending the scooter rally downtown and this location was perfect. 

Everything about the hotel was beautifully decorated and well maintained. Free parking across the street, no need to walk through smoky/stuffy lobbies, 24-hour secured entrance, friendly lobby staff that greet us all the time, free/different candy daily. The lobby, elevator, and hallway all were decorated with taste.

Room: We stayed in the Junior Suite. Very spacious, still had that new hotel smell, green walls were relaxing, flat screen HD TV on the wall, cute vintage-inspired furniture, soft low lighting (that's what I prefer), comfortable bed with clean bed sheets (not that quilt cover that other hotels don't wash), black and white tiled bathroom, mini fridge, and my favorite part of the mini bar was was a little tin called the "intimacy kit", but no thanks I brought my own! Window view was of the quiet street.

The neighbor hood is downtown, not a lot to do, but the Fremont Experience is very close. Unsure about the locals and the NASCAR fans were in the same area that weekend.

**DOWNSIDES**
$150 deposit that you'll get back in 5-10 days. Why does it take so long?! 
Plus, my room rate went up without the hotel notifying me- I had to find this out on my own. They said the rate went up because of NASCAR weekend, but I booked early through the internet. I called at the manager and he was able to adjust my rate back without any hassle.

Book a tour at least one month in advance! They tend to fill out 2-3 weeks before the date. $15 is fully worth it for a tour led by a knowledgeable volunteer or staff with interesting bits of history and trivia. 

The photos of the signs you see might change by the time you visit because they're constantly moving or renovating the signs they receive as a donation to the museum. By Summer 2012, they will have more signs from the current overflow, which were behind a gate when we visited last Saturday. 

Bring your good camera and make friends along the tour and have others take photos of you and your party. The tour took about an hour and a half, but I wish we had more time to wander the boneyard!

What kind of experience begins with what a customer thought was one of the best new car buying experiences they've yet had, 
quickly sours and turns into a HORRENDOUS display of 'customer service' devoid of all rational logic when the dealership is called out on their attempts to swindle customers in a scandalous RIP-OFFof a 'tire warranty/un-needed overpriced service' scheme, 
rancifies to a disgusting attempt to belittle and humiliate a customer and blame the customer for not being able to understand the terms of the warranty contract (which was understood completely, just understood by an intelligent customer to be an attempt to rip off those not willing to do the math and see what a scam it is), 
causing the customer to spend 2 hours in a parking lot of a nearby Target with a poster board and markers creating a PROTEST SIGN to stand on busy Bell Rd on a Saturday and try to let as many people as possible know about the SHEISTERS at Biddulph Mazda and the NASTY EXPERIENCE with their sales, service, and management,
causing dealership to attempt (*unsuccessfully*) to stop the customer's protest by CALLING THE COPS ON THE CUSTOMER,  
and the cops, after interviewing many parties, including other customers on the lot who interacted with the protestor by asking questions about what the backstory was, etc, did not, in fact, tell the protestor to stop, but simply left instructions about proper protest technique with which the protestor was already familiar and was already following

If you like plates fresh out of the dishwasher that are still hot with crusted food on them, and this was with multiple plates, this is your buffet. If you are extremely sodium deficient this is your buffet. If you like carved meats that make you wish for a meat tenderizer to beat them with this is your buffet. If you like semi-frozen out of the box desserts this is definitely your buffet. Go slow on your drinks as getting a server to refill it is next to impossible. When you walk in there are Zagat rated signs on the wall, with all due respect this place isn't worthy of being rated by Zagat. Your best bet is to stay on Boulder Highway and find someplace else to eat. One positive was the stir fry station manned by competent and friendly staff. It's the only thing that warrants a star.

This is a relatively new Chinese place in downtown Kitchener. It mostly features Cantonese dishes. 

Nice decor for a Chinese place. Modern, simple, clean, and spacious. It kinda gives the same vibe as Benh Than (the one near Conestoga mall after renovation). 

Food was not particularly memorable. The bbq duck was quite good, everything else was pretty average. Don't bother with the Hong Kong style tea, it's really bad. 

4 star for the ambience, service and adding more variety to Kitchener's food selections, 3 star for the food.

You will find minimal riff raff here, but isn't that part of the Vegas charm?
No, well then stay here for a luxurious pampering, great shopping, fine dining.
If not, leave your 100 oz plastic cup outside and have a glimpse of what you could be doing instead of puking margarita slushies in the bushes out front.

Counting cars is another one of those easy watching shows, my husband likes the cars, I like that the guys are so easy going and just plain nice, you don't see that much now a days anymore.
A lot of guys from the show were there, I had no idea this place had a following like Pawn Stars.
(though they don't have a line around the building or charge entrance)
Easy parking, sign in, and walk right in to see Danny's private collection as well as some other fun stuff.
They have an overpriced  gift shop, but who doesn't.
My husband loved their Dickie's jackets, but $145 is steep.
That aside, everyone was super nice, the vibe cool, the cars amazing and my guys got a nice break from the girly stuff they had to put up with the day before, win win.

This is such a unique museum, a must see for anyone.
There is alot you won't understand and think WTH is going on here but still appreciate for whatever they meant to portrait here.
I took so many amazing pictures and made so many lasting memories, even my son had a blast while not knowing what was going on here.
The free entry with a military ID was another bonus, but I would have gladly paid to see and experience this. 
My family is  not ito art or culture but this is a must see for anyone, very very cool, funky, worth the trip for sure.

Always a great meal at Hash House. Love everything I have tried on the menu from the salads to the salmon and of course the chicken and waffles. Service is nice and the portions as well as quality justify the price which is about $15-20 per entree. Food comes out quickly and is beautifully presented, a staple every time we come to Vegas!

Another walk along memory lane.
I first came here almost 10 years ago, back again now not much has changed.
Service is great, drinks are unique, everything is clean and spacious, I love the decor.
Though if you are trying to have a relaxed night out, this is not the place for you, it gets REALLY noisy.
Prices are Vegas average and the crowd all over the place, great time every time.

Aria is one of the newest Hotel/Casinos on the strip.
It has that whole modern/clean look, the designers here,also executed the remodel beautifully.
It's pretty small and crammed between others though, so that its hard to figure out when you are in which Casino/Hotel.
Not big enough to spend the entire day in but nice to stroll through and stop to have a drink/meal/gamble in a gorgeous atmosphere.

My god the all pastor is good here! Along with a side of their grilled onions and peppers, a meal could not get more perfect. My husband and son are obsessed with the half pastor half asada fries, they stay crispy, the guac is killer, we passed on the sour cream. Why they closed their prime location on the strip is beyond me, but both their other locations are close enough and more than worth seeking out.
Both have outstanding service, amazing food and way too long of a wait to get your food.
You really have to be lucky to find a seat here, worst case eat it in the car or outside, again more than worth it.
Prices are fair, the $10 will fill you up for days, the $2 tacos are tiny, get at least 4.
A must stop every time I am in Vegas!

5 stars for awesome burgers, great service and a great atmosphere!
This place is nice, in a good location, the girls and guys working are super friendly and bring the food out quickly.
I was starving when we arrived for a late lunch and their veggie burger really hit the spot!
I had the santa fe hippie 
grilled corn + black bean falafel burger,
guacamole, shredded lettuce, tomato,
pepperjack cheese, cilantro-lime creme fraiche
 which tasted like a huge crunchy falafel and the creme fraiche complemented this perfectly!
The man had the average joe since he wasn't that hungry and liked it as well.
Seriously one of the best meals I've had, very very good.
The place gets full but there is plenty of seating so it doesn't feel cramped, perfect for a casual date, get  together, wish we had one of these here!

5 stars isn't enough for my favorite Rubber Stamp store!  Nic is so creative and knowledgeable and helpful and caring and has the most beautiful stamps and her samples hanging all over the walls are gorgeous and inspiring!  I have made the most beautiful cards in her classes also.  I can't speak highly enough.  She's worth the drive from San Diego to Arizona !  And while you're there visit either of the deli's on each side of her for more friendly atmosphere and wonderful food!  I miss you guys!

This was the third place I attempted to go to for dinner last night.  The first place, Azucar Peruvian, was right across the street from the motel I always stay at and I'd been meaning to try them since last summer. I drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next. I snoozed, I loozed.

 The second place was supposed to be open till 8:30pm according to their Yelp listing, but was closed when I got there a few minutes after 8.

The third place, here, highly recommended on Yelp, was also out of business. FML.

I finally ended up at Yogi's Grill, also in Riverview Center.   Thank goodness they were open!

I have no idea when this placed closed or why, since their reviews were so good.

I meant go be going to the other Pho place on Southern but I overshot and missed it and found myself here instead, so I figured, what the heck.  It looks like maybe a former Taco Bell building.  As soon as I walked in I was enveloped by wonderful aromas of pho broth but in the AZ hot weather I opted for a cooler dish, the #45, Vermicelli with Charbroiled Shrimp and BBQ Pork.  It wasn't a large amount of food but it was delicious.  I ate it all, no leftovers.

Just about everything on the menu was between $6.25 to $6.75.  Can't get much more reasonably priced than that.

There are mostly Asian people in here, always a good sign the food is authentic.  The servers were very nice.

I hope I get back here to try another meal before I have to leave town.

I HATE YOU STARBUCKS! Well this one anyway!

Ok I was giving you the benefit of the doubt, but oh no honey this time you DID ME DIRTY! So I ALWAYS order the same drink: Hazelnut iced coffee. Simple right? NOPE! The little douche cashier charges me for a hazelnut iced coffee breve... NO LITTLE HITA I DID NOT ASK FOR THAT! So I wait in the long line, 5 minutes later I look at the counter and my drink is just sitting there... wtff?! CALL MY NAME! I was standing close enough to hear everything.

I got my drink and took a sip and it literally tasted like days old yucky coffee. I was super pissed, but why go back and say "Hey dbag, make this over? It tastes like shat bro!" No, you never know what they'll do to your drink. So here is my rant, I wasted money, time, and smiles on these little jerks!

Normally I LOVE CHIPOTLE! Alas tonight was a total let down!

So I havent had Chipotle in a very long time, and after getting my brows done by Glenn at Sumita, and rocking out in Forever 21 my little and I were hungry. Now I have been trying soooo hard not to eat here bc of the calorie factor but I broke down and got a chicken burrito.

I walk in and its like 30 mins to closing time so its pretty dead and theyre cleaning up. So I go and order, chicken burrito with pintos, hot salsa, cheese, crema, and lettuce. Pretty easy yea? Well She rang me up, I grabbed some salt and took my burrito to go. When I was in line I didnt like the way the chicken or beans looked, I shouldve taken that as a sign! 

I get into my car, and normally I dont do this but I got my burrito our and salted it and mixed it. I took a bite and was totally sad. The beans were a weird texture, the chicken was tasteless and dry, and the guacamole tasted like only avocados and no seasoning. I was super sad! I mean, Ive gone to many Chipotles and haven had a bad burrito or bowl! This one was a sad excuse!! Im gonna chalk it up to it was almost closing and the ingredients had probably been sitting there a little.

Anywho, the customer service was amazing, you can tell they were super ready to blow that Popsicle joint. 

Will I go back? Probs not to that Chipotle, its a lil more expensive bc of location and I have had better burritos at the one on Lake Mead, sorry for cheating on you by going to a diff location.

SMOKED SALMON SANDWICH why are you so delicious? 

With your caper dill cream cheese, daikon sprouts, red onions, and sliced hard boiled eggs you are one sexy, tasty sandwich that I couldn't put down. 

A drug perhaps? How can I be addicted to a sandwich?

It must have been your buttery smoked salmon pieces between the soft, pillowy bread that made my taste buds dance with joy.

It's okay, I'll ignore your $9.95 price tag because you're worth every cent!

Never in my time as a Yelper have I ever found a business (whether it would be a store, restaurant, monkey spanking service or what have you) rated at a full 5 stars in every review, NEVER. If that's the case, she's got to be good, right? 
The answer is: YES SIR.

I've been having severe back pains and was in dire need of some help to alleviate it so I told my husband about my findings and we booked appointments with Jill the following weekend.

Jill has a nice setup, decor and all. The moment that you walk in, to the moment you walk out, you're in a comfortable, professional environment and she's uber friendly!

This may sound a bit cliche but dammit, it's true: "It's nothing like you've ever had before". She customizes your massage to whatever your needs are. That, coupled with the fact that she is knowledgeable, educates you, listens to what is going on with you and takes the time to show that she really cares about getting you on your way to "Be Well" is something that sets Jill apart. Such an awesome name! 

After my massage, I felt so damn relaxed, more than I have ever felt after a massage. There is not another place out here that could ever change my mind about going to them, Jill @Be Well is where I'm going to from now on. My husband and I continued talking about our experience hours afterwards! We really likey!

To all the massaginists (Glee reference) in Las Vegas, Jill has set the bar pretty high, you guys are pretty much screwed as far as I'm concerned lol.

This place is such a gem. Watch out, though! If you blink, you'll miss it.

Nestled right next to Row House Cinema on Butler Street in Larryville, Smoke boasts no sign, or any promotional items outside alerting you to the glorious things happening inside. But as soon as you open the door, BAM! You know where you're at! 

I called ahead for reservations, but they didn't accept them. You can call 30 minutes before you're arrival, just to get your name "on the list". I did just that, and after the short ride from the North Side (minus the traffic on 28), my adventurous friend, Jess  and I were sat immediately at the bar. We both ordered lemonade, and it was gone before we knew it! So refreshing, simple and cold. It was topped with zest, and I saw them juicing lemons into our glasses when they refilled them. Next time we'll remember that they're a BYOB, and bring some beer! But I'll still get a lemonade. 

We went over the single page menu for a good amount of time, with help from the bartender. He made good suggestions, but didn't let us know about the Scorpion Wings, that were the special that day. (The only reason I'm giving a 4 and not a 5-star review) He told the guys next to us after we had already started eating, and I would have LOVED to try them. They smelled and looked amazing. 

We wound up ordering the Big Bowl 'O Cheese, with fresh tortilla chips (that I couldn't stop eating), a Brisket Taco, a ChickenApple Taco, and a side of Mac & Cheese.  I wanted to eat everything, and then eat the plate it came on. The cheese was on point, the chips were crispy, and the tacos....ooohhhh the tacos. The Brisket was tender, and the mustard on it was a perfect pair. I was slightly jealous of Jess's decision to get the ChickenApple taco. But she was nice enough to share! :) It was a little on the spicy side, but the crispy apples toned the kick down nicely. The Mac & Cheese was a last minute decision as a side, and I was so happy we added it on. Creamy, with cheddar and mascarpone cheeses, it melted in your mouth. 

Thank goodness they have boxes, because I took so much home. Jess and I escaped with a bill just under $35, but remember, they only accept CASH! but there's a PNC and a Citizen's ATM's bank right next door. 

All in all, GO HERE. Just make sure you plan ahead and give them a call! :) 

Happy Eating!

La Grande Orange is a cool cafe/ grocery store/ coffee house/ pizzeria/ gelato bar. It's a bit overwhelming on your first visit, trying to figure out where to go for what, and it gets a bit crowded and hectic. I sort of just picked a line and lucked upon the right one. 

I got the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, which you can order from the menu or pick up from their grab-and-go cold case, which is what I did. (Cuts down on wait time.)  Comes with 2 large iceberg lettuce cuffs, topped with their spicy chickpeas and avocado slices. These lettuce wraps are SO yummy and perfectly spicy.  Mine came with a fresh pineapple wedge; perfect for cleansing the palate. A nice, light, healthy, and filling option.  

There was a large dessert case, but there was only 1 vegan option: an apple pie cookie.  I started to pass (I had my heart set on a cupcake), but an employee convinced me to try one.  Great suggestion! It was one of the most delicious cookies that I have ever tasted. It was perfectly soft and chewy. An amazing treat!

The items in the grab-n-go section are labeled with the ingredients.

The parking situation is pretty insane.  They do offer complimentary valet parking (which I did not want to do), and there is another spill-over lot about a block north of the building.  I chose the later and walked back to the cafe.

i didn't check out their groceries, pizzeria, or gelato bar, so I cannot comment on that. However, per their menu, most pizzas can be made vegan. 

I would certainly return to see what other vegan desserts they have, and to get more of those yummilicious vegan apple pie cookies.

I came to this store to have some items laminated.  I waited up front for 10-15 minutes before anyone ever came to assist me.  One of the cashiers kept yelling over at me, telling me that someone was coming, so I continued to wait.  Finally, Ari (who is a manger) came and told me it'd be 1-2 hours before it'd be ready, which was not a problem. 

However, when I returned, my laminated items had extra plastic sticking out @ 6-inches in each direction.  I asked them to cut off the extra plastic down to size (which has always been done without asking at other Office Max locations). I was then told that it would cost extra to cut the excess plastic.  (However, he laminated my corporate discount card and it wasn't surrounded by miles of plastic.)  So I'm thinking, well, did they charge me for all of that extra plastic? These items were art class drawings, on 11 x 18 paper, so we're not talking a life-sized Thor poster board (which I'd totally laminate).  So here I am, trying to handle 13 pieces of H.A.M., and being cut all over my hands and arms at every turn.  Peeved!

THEN I asked him to explain the charges and he couldn't. I could not get an explanation of what I was being charged for.  I am certain that there are consumer laws regulating exactly this sort of thing!  I will never spend another dime in this store again. Ever.

W0o-hoo!  I am a fan... BUT note the review is for a WINDSHIELD CHIP REPAIR only.  My insurance does not cover windshield replacement so I was left to find a place that could do a chip repair.  The chip was a little bigger than a quarter.  A friend recommended Safelite and Diamond Glass.  Safelite quoted me $79.95 online!!  There is no guarantee the windshield won't crack so that was way too much to pay.

Diamond Glass was only $19.99!  They contract the work out to the local Jiffy Lube.  I drove up, 30 minutes later the chip was repaired!  BONUS.., they offer a 10% ASU DISCOUNT on all services and there is no tax so I ended up paying $17.99 out the door!

Great dim sum with all the classic favorites from ha gua to duck feet.  The place is huge so the wait isn't bad.  The servers are also really nice which is hard to come by.  For Chinese restaruants, they usually have good food and bad service or bad food and good service.  Great Wall has both.

Decided to switch up my regular spot for a while and give Jimmy and his retro decorated barbershop a few tries. I love the old school vibe, tv and machines and cool car-barber chair for the kiddos needing a chop. While I thought he did a decent job on my haircut I doubt I'll be back. I asked for a razor skin fade twice on two separate occasions and Jimmy still left some hair where there shouldn't have been. Ah well it seems like he's doing a bang up job with the other fellows on here so I'm not worried about him losing one guy. In the meantime I'll still continue to go to my regular spot in Hendertucky. 3 stars solid

Decided to switch up my regular spot for a while and give Jimmy and his retro decorated barbershop a few tries. I love the old school vibe, tv and machines and cool car-barber chair for the kiddos needing a chop. While I thought he did a decent job on my haircut I doubt I'll be back. I asked for a razor skin fade twice on two separate occasions and Jimmy still left some hair where there shouldn't have been. Ah well it seems like he's doing a bang up job with the other fellows on here so I'm not worried about him losing one guy. In the meantime I'll still continue to go to my regular spot in Hendertucky. 3 stars solid

I'm giving this 3 stars for the food only, not to hop on the train with all of the other reviewers but the staff really does suck. We watched 3 workers talk about how one of them was feeling ill and about how much ibuprofen she had taken that day...all while she prepared our food right in front of us. Seriously? I understand you having an off day but keep it professional. They continued to talk about what time they were all off and how the day was just dragging for them. All while we stood there. We love the food but next time we'll see if the other location on west sahara has better staff.

This place has always been on my radar but since I'm not a huge sweets person I never rushed to try. Had a friend mention that Sunmi's had patbingsu and needless to say I was all over that. 

I will say I was disappointed that my shaved ice came out to $14...but I understand why. The fruit shaved ice is typically served with what I'm guessing is vanilla ice cream perhaps? But me trying to be a major FA and be all fancy, decided that I wanted the red bean and fruit combined...thus $14. The size was really good with 2 scoops of ice cream a nice serving of the pat, fresh...yes fresh...strawberries, kiwis, mangos, mochi and more! Not sure of it was worth $14, but I didn't leave complaining at all. If I will say one thing it is that I wish the red bean ice cream was slightly softened a bit. I waited a few minutes before I dug in so that the ice cream would be easier to eat. The fruits were a bit on the sour side as well, but let's face it it is not primo fruit season just quite yet. All in all I'm happy I found a place with Korean shaved ice. I will not be fancy next time and ask them to combine two different types. Let's not fix something that ain't broke. 

I've never tried any of their breads but I have had their matcha cake and it is amazing. The flavored are so good, not too sweet and the green tea flavoring is not overpowering. The cake is also a kind of cream based, and it's...I dare to say...perfect. I'm dying to try their other cakes as well as their breads. Reading the other reviews it doesn't seem like I'll be disappointed at all. 

Atmosphere is great. Very quaint and quiet with two window tables and a larger table in the back. The breads are arranged in the left wall and the counter situated to the right with a small cake display in front of their menus. I went in on a Sunday afternoon so it was quiet except for the owners or managers? When I walked in the door I was greeted by a gleaming baby and I'm a sucker for babies. He was so adorable. I love the family bakery feel it makes the place way more cozy and inviting. I recommend it.

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS;;
GREENTEA CAKE ---
I've never tried any of their breads, but I have had their matcha cake and it is amazing. The flavored are so good, not too sweet and the green tea flavoring is not overpowering. The cake is also a kind of cream based, and it's...I dare to say...perfect. I'm dying to try their other cakes as well as their breads.

PATBINGSU ---
I will say I was disappointed that my shaved ice came out to $14...but I understand why. The fruit shaved ice is typically served with what I'm guessing is vanilla ice cream perhaps?

OVERALL;;
A promising little bakery nestled on a busy and bustling street. Their selection of breads seemed a bit more expansive than other local Asian bakeries. They keep it very simple and they seem to do what they do very well. I recommend this little bakery. I will be back to try more and give an updated review.

Possibly thing the miss most from living on the west coast is the abundance of taco trucks. This storefront taco stand is among the best I have had in Pittsburgh. Is it better than Reyna's Tacos (Strip)? Does it matter? Not really because depending on what part of town myself in I would take either.

You know how taco stands work right? Pick your meat carnitas, chicken, or steak. Then choose your veggies. Simple right? Yes Simple! I like the one in Oakland too.

I wanted to love it, but they didn't open on time. The service was slow and its weird they don't have menus. You have to order off the wall which is fine, but the waitress said they were working on getting menu's. In my mind that takes 10 seconds to print menus. My scramble came with wooden twig in it about 1.5 inches long. The ingredients were fresh, but the price to value of the meal wasn't really very good.

Gelato Bar is a clean spot but their gelato just doesnt hit the mark of being deserved to be called Gelato.. The interior is really clean and comfortable but they do still have a few small kinks to work on. Firstly their gelato a little too cold, as it touches the tongue it almost stings and numbs, after about 2 bites (literally) I had to stop because it was just too cold to eat. Instead of a creamy and smooth consistency, its more hard and icy and breaks off when you scoop it, again most likely because their coolers are too cold. It was so hard in fact when the girl tried to put the wafer crisp in it, she accidentally broke it and had to replace it with a new piece, and while she was scooping it. It had the texture of cheap ice cream left in the deep corner of a freezer for months. Gelato should be soft and smooth. Another thing that Irked me was that upon entering, the girl working there didn't event know the name of their own establishment and said "welcome to... laughed and had to look at the sign... gelato bar." She also had no clue about any of their flavors, and wasn't very helpful.

 The upside though, their prices are pretty cheap and reasonable and they have a buy 2 get 1 scoop free going on now which is not bad.

I was hoping for a new spot to get gelato that was away from the strip and a little closer, but I guess if I want gelato I'm still going to be heading to either forums shop or Art of Flavors..

Ending Summary: Clean spot, staff are nice but not very knowledgeable about their own establishment name or products, gelato too hard and icy. 1 star worthy.

I had a taste of about 4 or 5 different items from this gluten-free bakery.  Everything was delicious.  A white chocolate and nut covered cakey pastry, a baguette, potato chips, a chocolate cake, and some other pastry I don't remember.  The desserts were amazing.  Tasted like a normal fantastic dessert.  The chips were... well... chips.  And the baguette was pretty good, but not like normal bread.  It almost seemed  gritty.  But for gluten-free, it was good enough.
I'd happily go back and get whatever pastries tickled my fancy.

I went for a run through here on my recent trip to Montreal.  I was staying close by, so I also ran the 5 blocks to/from the park.  It has plenty of paths and sidewalks, as well as a large pond and fountain.  There's a decently sized hill and a small wooded area you can run through.  There are also tennis courts, basketball courts, a hockey rink, soccer fields, a baseball field, and lots of grassy areas for laying out in the sun.  There was also a swimming pool, but it was closed :(
I thoroughly enjoyed my run through here, despite its brevity.

If you make the mistake and get a room here- DO NOT get sucked into any of the timeshare presentations!! They will offer $75-$100 just to go, and they will say it's not a "high pressured" meeting, but it is. It's actually a huge scam that Diamond resorts is running! As far as the rooms here, they are nice... But this company is all about getting you to become an "owner". So once you are in their territory- they will constantly bug he crap out of you to try and attend one of these meetings. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. Any location run or owned by Diamond resorts is pathetic and likes to try and scam their guests.

I found Habitat on Yelp because my wife being gluten free has a hard time going out for breakfast. So I wanted to give her a little treat and take her to a place that could cater to the needs of the GF community. We came here on Tuesday.  When I called the person that I initially spoke to apparently was not aware of the gluten free options but lo and behold when we got their our fantastic and meticulous waitress Jessica was well versed on what was and was not gluten free on the menu. She also enlightened us to the fact that they had all the right GF flours to make pancakes and waffels. So weren't told that  when we called but were delighted to hear that we could in a future visit call ahead to give them time to whip up whatever batch of batter to make which ever GF breakfast item we wanted. 

So we ordered off the menu. My wife order a fruit plate that came with gluten free banana bread. I ordered a regular bagel and lox, side of bacon and side of hash browns, coffee and tea. We were blown away by the food and service. My wife's fruit plate was presented elegantly with gigantic mouth watering hunks of sweet pineapple, crunchy watermelon, big fat blueberries, grapes, melon and other fruits.  On the side two nice sized triangles of some of the best GF banana bread I have ever tasted.  Now granted I'm the one that order lox and a bagel with bacon and hash browns. And I was jealous! 

So, what about my meal? My bagel was perfectly toasted with cream cheese on the side. Accompanying the bagel was a plate containing what must have been an entire pound of very delicious and fresh lox, capers and fresh red onion! Wow! Just Wow!  The thick crispy bacon and hash browns were perfect. We were happy and had a great time. Our waitress Jessica really made the experience the best it could be.

Visited one day this week at lunch time. The wait for my juice was reasonable- maybe 5-10 minutes. The service was prompt and professional. I liked the little tables they had and waited there for my order. 

The juice itself tasted good, if not just a tad sweeter than I would consider perfect. It was called "Toxin Flush" or something like that. It was a blend of parsley, apple, ginger and maybe one other thing I've forgotten. It was just a little vegetable-y and a little spicy from the ginger. They gave me a choice of having it on ice or not (no ice!). 

The menu looks to be limited to the pre-designed selections. I don't think you can create your own combination. The price was lower than many other juice places and the location is convenient. Even though the huge parking lot is often completely full at lunch time, I found a spot right in front of the store the day I went. 

I will definitely visit Nekter again and try one of the other juice offerings.

"Sell and never deliver" seems to be the motto of The Brick. I purchased a refrigerator and here it is THIRTY DAYS after purchase and it still isn't here. 

I have blown three separate days sitting around waiting for a delivery with promises from phone reps - after the 3 hour delivery window had come and gone - that "they'll be there today, they're just running late!" 

Only to find out the next day that that driver said he came by and no one was home. And of course, they didn't think to call. The best part is that when they reschedule, it's 10 days after that.

What a cruel joke of a business this is. Avoid.

Not a thrift store fan in general, but they have 50% off Saturdays every other Saturday, I believe. I went to look for a second monitor for working from home occasionally and ended up paying $3.50 for a perfectly working small flat screen monitor and cables. Cannot beat that. I was very excited. 
The place itself is kind of smelly though and not very pleasant looking. I have been in there a couple of times now and I feel like thrift stores are more and more packed with very old, dirty items. Also, half off Saturday means it is packed in there. All registers were working and lines were crazy long. One man's trash is another man's treasure I guess.

I would give 5 stars to this gym for the quality of their equipment and the facility but 2 stars to the service and staff. 
We have been to this gym almost 6 times to get rates and every time we are given a different rate, always way too high to be even close to affordable and higher than what most our friends are paying for this gym. Today we went again to get rates and as I told the guy that we have been given different rates he said that this is not true and their rates have not changed for months, but then as we said we would like more time to think about it, he said, as you know our rates change weekly.... WHAT? so he was very contradictory in his words, and still could not work something out for us... :((

This is my favorite chain steakhouse in Charlotte.  Excellent food, much better price than Sullivans, Ruth Chris, Chimas...  The house martinis are all good. The seared Ahi Tuna is a must, the chilli rubbed delmonico steak, Baked potato is salt rubbed ust right, mushrooms, and the creme brulee cheesecake for desert.  Make sure you call ahead or you will be waiting.  BTW, the one on Rae Rd is better than the one in South Park.

Have heard of this place and the deliciousness of its fare and decided to check it out while it Vegas.

I bought two sandwiches (jerk and chipotle chicken) and a Caesar salad to take away for myself and my boyfriend. Mixed reviews. My jerk chicken sandwich was warm, fresh and utterly delicious. No complaints. My boyfriend however only rated his chipotle average. Likewise the Caesar salad was ordinary at best and I would have liked there to have been more than just a small half-full container of dressing.

It's definitely worth trying however you and your pocket might be more satisfied with the nearby Subway.

It's definitely worth trying however you and your pocket might be more satisfied with the nearby Subway.

I had a terrible recent experience at Marquee that has convinced me I should never step foot in that club again. I sent the letter below to guest relations for both the Cosmopolitan and Marquee over a month ago and received no response. This club is dangerous, unethical, and unsafe. Furthermore, they seem to only care for patrons who are straight. It's 2015, this behavior is unacceptable. 

Dear Management,

I am writing to you today in regards to an incident that occurred at the Marquee nightclub, located in your hotel. On the night of 10/17/2015, I entered Marquee with my male cousin and a female friend. 

A group of female friends of mine were celebrating a bachelorette party and had purchased a table for the night. I was invited by the group to come by the table and celebrate with them.

Upon entering the table area, located to the left of the DJ booth, a security guard immediately grabbed my cousin and I and pulled us out of the area forcefully. Due to his actions, I almost fell over and bumped into one of my female friends. 

The security guard then told us that this was a table reserved only for women and we had to leave. After informing him that the table was paid for by my friends and they had personally invited me, he continued to push us violently away from the table. 

This action was shocking and upsetting to me and the women at the table. The security guards actions were aggressive and inappropriate and he had no right to violently touch me and my cousin. The entire party found this action unprofessional, sexist, and incredibly dangerous to our safety as patrons of your establishment. 

I know certain nightclubs in the Las Vegas area grant free admission to women in hopes of enticing male patrons. Some staff may have seen two men near a female group and thought that they were a "threat" to business. However, as a gay man I also find this behavior sexist and homophobic. 

I would like to speak to whomever is in charge of safety and/or guest services so we may resolve this matter. What should have been a memorable night for all those involved turned into an upsetting event. My friends and I are apprehensive about frequenting your hotel as we are concerned for our safety due to this event. 

We are planning to be in Las Vegas from 11/20-11/22 to celebrate another bachelorette party. I hope your establishment can convince us that you welcome all patrons regardless of gender or sexual orientation. If you would like to speak to another witness of this event, I'd be happy to provide you with their contact information.

Getting in was a bit of a problem but that's Vegas for you. I just wish security guards weren't such dicks. Just because you couldn't make it through police academy doesn't mean you have to take it out on us! 

Anyways, the club itself was really fun. The outdoor area is a lot better and you can actually talk to people. The interior wasn't anything special but they had an amazing DJ and lights. They even threw giant glowsticks into the crowd, which was cool. I was most impressed by the bathrooms and how organized everything was. The owners get major props for that.

I have been trying their soups for the past two weeks. There is always a queue around lunch time (obviously lots of companies offices around here). The fresh sandwiches do seem very tempting, I must say. 

I think it's the little things that make the difference: big selection of soups (at least four per day, sometimes 6!), home-made bread, Lurpak butter for spreading, Fresh orange juice, Maple syrup latte coffee... 

Of course, consistently high quality of the provided food as well is highly appreciated. 

No surprise I'm regular there!!! 

Give it a go and I bet you will enjoy it!

I've been to Trader Joes once before to get an understanding of the concept of the store and see what they had to offer. TJs doesn't have any name brands that you are accustomed to at most grocery stores. That was a bit of a turn off for me as I enjoy couponing and am very brand loyal. Nevertheless, I returned on a whim for flowers and was impressed by the quality and prices of their flowers. They had bouquets of 8 roses for $5. So I ended up buying 5. The selection greatly exceeded that of Harris Teeter. I'll have to follow up once they have fully bloomed and see how long they last.
- Follow up. After making two arrangements, one bloomed beautifully and the other did not.

Follow up - one bouquet bloomed and the other one did not. There are pictures showing the difference.

Love this new location!  It's conveniently located right up the street from me & has a great ambiance.  The bartenders are always friendly!  The first night we went something rather strange occurred though.  The staff kept coming in and out from outside so we asked what was going on and found out that the owners car was broken into and his windows were shattered and this happened at his house the day before.  Didn't leave the best feeling in our stomachs but everything has been fine and dandy besides that time!  The Mac & Cheese bites are always fantastic.  My friend tried the Cookies & Cream pancakes which were basically just chocolate chip pancakes.. Not the best name for what you get.  

If you're looking for a chill, fun environment to catch a game or grab a drink & snack with friends this is your place!

A Dole whip float on your way to the Hoover Dam??? What in the world is going on?? I don't care, my heart was just so happy to stumble upon this frozen treat gem and not have to be at the happiest place on earth to get one of the yummiest treats i know in the dead of Nevada summer.

Of course everything is just a little better at Disneyland, but this pineapple Dole whip float sure was delicious and super refreshing. 

This place was pretty cute, too. Little bit of the 50s cafe vibe to it. They also have self-serve frozen yogurt (Dole pineapple is available for self-serve) & they serve food, corn dogs, sandwiches, burgers, cool little spot.

They also have baked goods and I bought some cookie/brownie fusion deliciousness but forgot.what it was called haha.

Bottom line, on your way to the Dam or near the area, stop by!

Fantastic change of pace. I loved their Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes and their Pork Schnitzel is also amazing. All dinners come with a multitude of delicious sides. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here is about as romantic as a K-mart -- Luckily they are moving to a new bigger and better spot on Baseline soon (hopefully without the florescent lighting). Bonus: The new spot with also have a bar - the owner showed me the plans.

Decided to try this Starbucks as it has a Clover machine. Had a Komodo Dragon and it was very flavorful. Everything about this Starbucks is up to the usual high standards. Not the most parking-friendly location, but there is ample parking if you are willing to walk 50 meters or so. Nice friendly baristas. Lots of sitting space.

This Starbucks is perfectly located between the Arizona Biltmore area and the walking trails of the Phoenix Mountains Preserve.
The only negative to this location is the dearth of parking. There are a few (about 15) good spots but the rest of the parking area may require a walk of up to 100 meters.
The actual restaurant is very inviting with outside seating in two patio areas that are on two sides of the store.
The coffee baristas all seem very knowledgeable and I have seen some of the same baristas for almost a year.
This is one of the growing number of Starbucks stores with a Clover machine. There is therefore a large variety of quality coffees and unique blends from which to choose if you want to try a clover-brewed coffee.
The latte that I ordered was just as I expected-delightful. 
I also ordered a turkey pesto panini which was very tasty. I wanted one of the new wraps, but they had already sold out-bummer.
Overall, an excellent Starbucks experience, as usual.

This place is absolutely phenomenal. The service is excellent everyone really does seem like they enjoy their jobs there, so that always helps make the overall vibe/ feel a lot better. Drink selections  were very wide which is always a perk. Lots of juices housemaid drinks and plenty of alcohol. But the thing that I was thoroughly impressed with was the great selection of delicious foods that were in the buffet. You get everything from pan Thai noodles, blue cheese stuffed tortellini with pork sausage,or even get pan seared salmon. Now it's one thing to have a wide selection of great foods but it's another for them to taste good as well because sometimes when you get quantity you really sacrifice quality. And this place break that rule there's a wide variety of things you can get, and each of them taste like he was personally made for you!

All in all, the aesthetics are really nice, lots of lux gold and mood lighting. The layout of the buffet is really convenient and it gives you a good view of all of the different cultures of foods that are offered here! Everything from fishmonger, Classic Italian, Asian even beer and wines! The quality of the foods is what's keeping this a 4 star instead of a 5. The verity really is a huge bonus! I got spicy streamed broccoli, and also pad Thai noodles . The shining gem in this buffet is definitely the desert bar! Holy cow! The selection is fantastic and the quality is prime. I had a very fresh and sweet fruit tart and raspberry sorbet also a Nutella moose shooter, I was definitely pleased. In the end I wouldn't come here. But seems how the meal was free for me I can't complain too much!

My daughter has been coming here for 2 weeks. I know it's a little early for a review, but I'll make sure to update this review in a month. So far I love that they actually do things with the toddlers. This place reminds of Bright Horizon. I think this place is a little cheaper. I love that there is a curriculum. They have circle time and when I picked her up today, the teacher was blowing bubbles and the toddlers loved it. The other day i picked her up one of the teachers was playing blocks with the kids. For now, I am very satisfied. I'll check back in and let you all know how much she has learned. Which is one if the main reasons I moved her here. STAY TUNED! :)

The front desk staff are all nice, but every now and then when I sneak up on the class the teachers are talking and the kids are everywhere. Standing on the desk, playing with the water. Its chaos, but just like any daycare, its not perfect. 

I've also sneaked up and seen the teachers educating the kids with song and playtime. Its an awesome place to take your kids too. My little one has learned a lot and loves to sing. Its all because of this place. It is pricey though compared to other places.

As of 11/18 I pay 235 a week for my 21 month old... If I had to leave, this would be the reason why, but my daughter loves it so much I don't have the hear to take her out.

I really can't say enough about our experience here...start to finish, it was 10/10 on all fronts!

I wanted to have a birthday dinner with a bunch of friends, but I made the mistake of waiting until Saturday  morning to make a reservation for Saturday night. woops. Fortunately, Bootleggers was able to accommodate my original request for a group of 10 on the patio--which is gorgeous. I called a few hours later and upped the res to 12...no problemo. As is common with big groups, not everyone RSVP'ed to me and we ended up being a group of 16. Still, they made it work without a hitch or sigh.

Having worked in the industry myself, I know how it can be to serve a big group that grows even bigger, and everyone was talking over each other and going nuts half the time. Our server handled it like a champ!

The food was awesome -- everyone had good things to say about their chosen dishes, including my vegetarian friends who ordered a bunch of the veggie side dishes and really loved them. I personally ordered the wedge with chicken added and it was great. from other plates I tried the pulled pork mac and cheese, burger, cauliflower side, potatoes and probably some other stuff. 

All of that being said, the best part of the night was the guy who made my birthday dinner extra special by bringing out a round of apple cinnamon moonshine and a banana bread pudding for me. As we were leaving, we found out he was the owner of the place! Super cool guy. He came out to take a group photo for us and even thought to bring up the lighting on the patio beforehand to make sure we got a good photo. It was really thoughtful of him on both accounts. 

We will definitely be back!

It's with a heavy heart that I bring you this review of the once-beloved Bombay Spice. You're dead to me now. 

I was a huge fan and frequent diner at the old location. I loved bringing friends there and my husband and I enjoyed the Wednesday date night special on more than one occasion. Unfortunately, those are just memories. 

There is no way I would go here to enjoy a glass of wine and samosa or curry. 

This new location looks like a crappy diner and the "chipotle style" order line just misses the mark. The servers literally just dump food into the to-go containers and man the till.   The food quality and quantity has plummeted...not to mention the lost appeal of FRESH food. I have some friends who eat a vegan diet and they appreciated the ability to request modifications to their meals. Not such, any more.  The lentil soup was reminiscent of the old recipe but came with about three bites and was bland overall.  

RIP, Bombay of Olde.

Take the genius of a frozen margarita, then multiply that by many other boozy flavors.

It's also great because there are multiple Evening Call locations throughout Vegas, so you buy a giant cup and get a discounted refill the entire time you're cruising Sin City.

All your life, you've had shows you loved canceled because some mystery idiot with a Nielsen box refused to watch.

Now... YOU have the power.

Swing by this place (near the MGM Grand pool entrance) and you'll sit down to see a mystery show.  As you watch, you turn a nob on a Nielsen controller.  You're just letting them know how much you like a given moment in a show.  And if you hate it, you can drop the knob to zero... and even hit the "tune out" button.

Afterward, you fill out survey questions about the show.

It's surprisingly fun.

When my girlfriend and I did it, we both HATED the host of the reality show we watched.  As soon as we got out, I asked her what she thought and she started ripping the host apart.  I had never been more attracted to her.

For your time, they give you an envelope of coupons, but I didn't get the $20 bill some other Yelpers got.  Even without the incentives, it's cool to have something free to do after you lose all your money in the casinos.  And who knows... you might get to see the next great hit or the next spectacular flop before the rest of the country!

Note: They can't tell you what show you'll watch, but they will tell you what it's rated.

We have ordered pizza from here a few times--they are one of the FEW places that does North Side deliveries.  We usually get black olive + mushroom + hot pepper pizza, and it's just okay.  Better than Pizza Hut but not life-changing or anything.

Their cheesy breadsticks are AWESOME, though.  I could just eat those for dinner.  They are doughy, cheesy, and perfect.  

The service has always been speedy and the delivery guys are nice.  

If you're ordering online, make double sure you have your order right:  I ordered a small pizza one time on accident and called to make it a medium, and they couldn't change it for me over the phone--told me to go online and change it, which online ordering sites don't let you do.

This is easily the worst gyno I've been to. I have unfortunately been here twice and the second time only out of pure desperation because I needed a new script for the pill. Both times they messed up on my insurance information and i had to deal with my insurance, their office, and the lab that processed my Pap smear. No lie, that process took at least 4 months for everyone to get their act together. It was such a huge inconvenience that I was going to find another gyno for my second check up but I was running out of the pill and needed them to write me an emergency one month script till I could get an appointment. They forgot to call the prescription in. They forgot, after I called them twice to remind them what pharmacy and even their number!!! Like an idiot I didn't call target to check before hand and drove all the way there to find out that they FORGOT!!!!! I cannot stress enough how awful this place is and please for your own sanity do not go to this place. I will never be returning.

I always wish threaders would do this...because there are some hairs that just need a tweezer. 

She sat me up and looked at my shape that way which no one has ever done before. 

Come here and ask for her! You won't be disappointed!

This food is simply substandard when you take into consideration the price that they're asking. If you want really salty fake meat, average concepts, flavourless yet overly salty sauces, microwaved food (I know right?!?) served by slow wait staff, bad music and uncomfortable plastic chairs this is right up your dystopian alley and is probably just the place for you. I really don't know how they have existed for so long seeing as how there are so many excellent vegetarian restaurants in the Plateau, let alone the entire city. If East Asian vegetarian cuisine is what you're looking for, don't get it here ... go somewhere else like Yuan Vegetarian or Su Shian Yuang. Sorry to be so harsh but I tells it like it is. Peace.

Korean cuisine is absolutely epic! Epic flavours and epic presentations of epic proportions. This is an age old and a time tested to perfection sort of cooking. 

As a vegetarian dining at a Korean BBQ joint I am always thankful that I leave stuffed, satiated and pleased beyond belief.

Panch'an is the general term that refers to the small side dishes that are served with any Korean meal. Kimchi is an integral part of the dining experience and it damn well should be. Kimchi is oh so good! Who the hell thought cabbage could be so interesting? Namul falls under the category of panch'an but consists of those side dishes that involve vegetables. They are absolutely delicious. The simplicity, subtlety and diversity of flavours hints at the unique and ancient quality of these recipes. My favourite namul is the kongnamul which is a beautiful cold bean sprout marinated in sesame oil and rice wine vinegar. Musaengchae is chicory tossed in a savoury hot pepper and sesame. Gogumasum is boiled potato in a light sweet vinegar. 
Oi sobagi are these delicious seasoned cucumbers. Mmm my mouth is watering just at the thought of them. They come complimentary with your meal and traditionally are unlimited ... so unbuckle that belt and prepare that second and third stomach because we are going to gorge ourselves like Romans eating Korean on free appetisers all night! 

If you want to stay for a main dish and not just dine and dash on excellent and free side dishes then you really must order the dolsot bibimbap! This is the archetype of warming and scrumptious down home comfort food. This is a hot stone bowl that cooks your meal right in front of your eyes. Imagine a perfectly cooked bed of wild rice; soft yet crisp on the edges. Then all the vegetables you could imagine piled sky high with some tofu then topped with an egg like a cherry on top. Add your Korean hot sauce to taste and / or the especially burn-your-mouth-off pepper concoction which they make just for themselves and yours truly. Mix, let cook as you eat and enjoy!

Get the ginseng tea with the deep fried green tea ice cream afterwards. 

Enjoy!   !

Mehh that's my overall impression and experience. I expected to be a bit more impressed however I was underwhelmed with the food and the cleanliness. When I speak on cleanliness I am referring to the child high chair which was brought out to me at the seemingly upscale restaurant. I carry Wet Ones in my diaper bag because I disinfect high chairs before placing him into one BUT once I wiped the seat of this one my wipe was covered in old food and dirt Ewwww. What happened to chairs being cleaned by the restaurant after each use?
This was my second stop on my seven day restaurant week tour through the QC.
I've been to Blue twice before once during the DNC & once during CIAA for a day party and both times I had a great time and only had drinks and passed foods that were flavorful.

I started with the salad which was extremely small in size and not as big in flavor as o would've expected from the size however the presentation was great.

My main course was the NC trout which was good however nothing spectacular. The sauce atop was red and a bit spicy which was not a problem as I adore spice. 

Dessert was THEE Highlight of the dinner as my neighbor talked me into Blue because she resides in Europe for years and LOVE Sticky Toffee pudding and saw that Blue was offering it for dessert. I decided to order he cheesecake in which I sent back because it was soooo DRY. I broke down and orders the pudding and OOOOOHHHH MY OOHHH MY it was PERFECT and the only thing memorable about the dinner and the only thing I would go back for.

Absolutely beautiful! 

There was quite a bit of snow on the ground when we went to visit, and while we didn't get to see any of the landscaping, festive lights, or seasonal decorations, we did see beautiful, well maintained trees and fresh snow everywhere.  We took a long walk through the park, ended up standing on top of a frozen lake (on purpose) and got to enjoy the cool breeze without many other visitors.

Juliette & Chocolat gets 5 stars from me without hesitation. The first visit with 3 of us and we each ordered something different so we could share. My second visit was alone and I sat by the window while it rained outside and it was truly like a dream come try.

My sweet tooth has never met it's match until I indulged in the Caramel Explosion. I'm salivating now just thinking about it. We also had a chocolate crepe and a nutella crepe, both with bananas and strawberries. 

My solo trip included The Nutella Decadent and some hot chocolate. 

The prices are a bit high and they were incredibly busy our first trip, forcing us to wait for nearly 30 minutes before somebody even took our order. But we understand and were aware of what to expect. The service was fantastic regardless.

BEST COFFEE EVER

Love this place.
Actually maybe a bit better than my other review of Victor Allen's...but I like their cafe a bit better. 

Get the Ancora D'Oro for home, and the White Zombie for right now. (Almond flavor is my favorite) 
Or the mocha, which is heavenly. Seriously, the best mocha I've ever had. EVEREVEREVER. The chocolate has some weight, but blends perfectly to be a grown-up version of chocolate milk you had as a kid. 
The White Zombie is a strange and beautiful thing. A "white coffee" drink, it's light and powerful, you will feel like a high-powered cloud ghost zooming around after drinking this. They tried to change the name to White Lightning, but no one wants to feel a crackling electric jolt. Don't worry, the zombie will carry you through the day like a white flotaki magic carpet, smooth, airy and sensuous.

At least the African Nut Stew and Injera are good.

This is hands down the best breakfast place in town. They do a super lunch and dinner as well, but I usually can't get off the breakfast selections. The "California Omelette" (Avocados, Mushrooms, and Jack Cheese) is superb, as is "The Volcano" which is made up of three fluffy / yummy pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs. 

As other reviewers have noted, portions are ginormous. Go planning to share a selection or take at least another meal home with you. There can be a wait on the weekend, but once you get seated, service is prompt and attentive. (Albeit the Fuzzie Bear that walks around can get a little creepy around the fourth table pass).

BBD is supposed to be known for their desserts and they do look good, but the blackberry pie that I took home was more than a little tart and the crust was on the tough side. I wouldn't let this stop you from sampling as it could have been an isolated experience based on their reputation.

There are actually a few locations in the Phoenix area, so visit their website to see which one is closest to you. http://www.blackbeardiner.com/

This definately isn't your parent's Denny's!

Finally made my way to Fattoush and I have to say "mmm mmmm good!" Not since my old neighbor, a refugee from Iraq, moved out have I had I experienced such robust flavors combined with healthy food. Lord I miss that man!!!

So yeah there isn't much of an atmosphere, the pictures don't really fit in the molding that was hung to frame art, but does that effect the food? Absolutely not! Physically, not much has changed since this place was the Green Leaf Cafe which was the predecessor to the Persian Garden. Except that the food here is less on the fusion side of Mediterranean flavors and more middle-eastern authentic Iraqis with a little Jordanian thrown in.

I love that you start out with the green lentil soup or salad with every meal. The name of the restaurant actually comes from said salad, which is a mix of romaine, tomatoes, cucumber, mint and toasted triangles of pita bread, covered with a tart balsamic vinegar dressing. But the soup is where it's at. It's unlike your average lentil soup - smooth and creamy, with bits of pasta. Very mild. It's a nice homey touch which is really what this food is all about. And that homey touch comes naturally, as the two main staffers are brother and sister. Their mom often helps out in the kitchen (and dad is busy cooking in Scottsdale).

When we arrived there were just two tables with guests, so we had our pick of eating spots. And there were a steady stream of people coming in for take-out throughout our visit. 

The menu is actually quite large considering their kitchen is about the size of my bathroom. On this visit, my sis and I decided to sample as much as we could to get a feel for the place. She was a little iffy as she had never had this kind of food, but once the dishes started rolling out, she quickly became a fan. We started with the fava beans, mixed with olive oil, garlic, and lemon. Main courses consisted of the Falafel Plate which comes with warm pita, hummus, pickles, and tomatoes and Chicken Shwarmas which were spiced perfectly and had juicy - dare I say succulent chicken. We topped the meal off with some freshly made baklava and rolled our way out to the car for our trip home.

Just after the soup course, a large Ford taxi pulled up and out of it piled out 8 full grown (some more fully grown if you get my drift, than others) ME men. It was sort of like the proverbial clown car... I mean seriously I didn't know you could get that many men in one car. They headed straight for the table next to us and then things really started to pick up. Four of them ordered Lamb Kuzi and the rest all got something different. Let me just say that my sister had to hold me down because their food all looked so good. Their table was literally crammed full of dishes with smells so good that I swear my nose grew just trying to get a better whiff!

Our meal came to $25  but in retrospect, we really didn't need all three dishes and could have easily gotten out of there for about $16. Service was attentive, food was phenomenal (and healthy - how often do you find that?!!), and it's only .5 miles from my house. This is probably the best ME food that I've had at a local restaurant and the place would definately warrant the coveted 5-stars on the food alone, but the afore mentioned atmosphere knocks it down one. It may have taken me years to get over to Fattoush, but it won't be long before my next visit! That Kuzi is calling me!!!

The previous reviewer incorrectly said they don't have take out; they do.  In fact you can get your take-out in one of three ways; walk up, radio ahead and pick up without even leaving your boat, or have it delivered out to your boat in a slip.

The marina itself is an excellent facility and very well maintained.  The staff goes out of their way to make your time enjoyable and stress-free.  Everything we've asked for has been met with a friendly "yes" and just gets taken care of.  This is in start contrast to the other marina on the lake, which we moved from.

The facility itself is constructed of wood docks over floating platforms.  There are excellent and spacious shower and bathroom facilities for the slipholders.  Everything is kept well maintained and clean.  There is a fuel dock, pump-out dock, restaurant, reasonably stocked store, and the marina management office is on site.

The store features the usual boating necessities and some major items like batteries.  Prices carry a little bit of the usual on-the-water premium, but I've seen far worse.  Service is friendly and helpful from everyone involved--managers to fuel attendants.

Everything seem like it was going great until my moms order came out and mines seemed to have a major lag... Not to sure why when I had a sashimi bowl which is faster to make then a combination plate. My mom was almost done with her dinner... Still no sashimi bowl. The owner seen I looked distressed and came to our table. I told him that I was upset about my food not coming out.... He apologized... And about 10 mins later my bowl and our tempura came out. Food was great. Only thing that upset me was the timing of my food coming out late. The owner Go was nice to send over takoyaki... Which I thought was very sweet of him. He came over to check on us and we ended up talking up about all things Japan. The takoyaki here taste just like takoyaki in Osaka. I will be back! Arigato Go! It was nice to meet you! I'll be back.

My weekly food budget is usually around 50 bucks (it's just the 2 of us and we eat out way to much) and I always leave with loads of yummy items! I'd spend twice this at Wild Oats quite easily. 

There are some checkers there that are very easy on the eyes! Always a plus in my book!! Each week holds many surprises for me and our menu.. always look forward to shopping here!!

Ya know what, it didn't suck nearly as bad as I thought it was going to. The service was really friendly and laid back.. I have to say that the server assistant was hot as hell and really flirty.. apparently Pink Taco wasn't on his mind.. maybe more like Pink Burrito.. I digress.. 

Chips and salsa were fantastic! Served in a bucket, their piping hot and came with some very tasty salsas.. neither salsa was hot so we asked for something hotter.. she brought out habenero salsa which was very tasty but not that hot either.. I think my tolerance might be high for spicy.. 

Order quesadillas, chicken enchilads and the burrito mojado.. the quesadilla was fantastic, cheeselovers unite! Their quesadillas are packed with a cheese blend and tons of it! Served with guacamole, chile paste and sour cream so the mixing and matching options are great!  

Burrito was humongous and filled with tender pork then covered in a nice smoky salsa, avocado and cheese. Along side wasn't your typical rice and beans but a very refreshing mixed green salad.. no iceberg here, dandelion leaves instead.. dressed very well with a light vinaigrette, very nice! 

The green chicken enchiladas were extremely tasty and get this, the chicken was fresh! These were served with rice and beans.. the beans were decent enough, pretty run of the mill but the rice sucked. Was either really old or really undercooked.. either way, suck.

All in all I was expecting far worse from The Pink Taco but was pleasantly surprised by how a-okay it really is. Id certainly go back when I'm in the mood for some good chips and salsa.. oh yes, and they really cute busboy!

When my friends told me they were taking me to the 4 Seasons for breakfast I thought they were kidding. A 4 Seasons, on the strip? Who knew? A completely surprising and wonderful experience. 

Be sure to have the Huevos Rancheros! The red sauce they prepare is so rich and creamy it would be probably make a fun dinner ice cream! I do ding them for using jarred salsa.. I'm sure that most of the cooks in the back have awesome salsa recipes.. the chef needs to hit them up, seriously! Also a ding on the so so pastry basket.. come on now.. this is the 4 Seasons.. I bet they could bring something better in than what they currently serve.

In all the chaos and drama on the strip this is one of the most secluded feeling and comfortable escapes. I look forward to coming back soon!

Centro Paninoteca in Scottsdale is a wine bar concept with tasty menu and an excellent wine list that's all well priced. But in this case, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

At Paninoteca it's all about trade-offs. The service is friendly, but ditsy and confused. The food is really good, but the kitchen runs at a snail's pace.

When we visited, apparently there was one only cook, not good if you're looking for a quick bite. However, we were told a few times by staff members that the kitchen was running slow, so kudos for communication.

Decor is home grown, with the space being mostly lit by a flat panel TV next to the bar. It's not really the sexy vibe you'd expect from a wine bar. The faint musty smell of mildew lingered in the air, but the outdoor dining area will remedy this issue.

More than making up for the restaurant's shortcomings is the food. The Crustini ($9.50) was covered with imported chevre, slow roasted tomatoes, Parmesan and olive oil. Each tangy bite paired well with my glass of Starry Night Old Vine Zin ($12). Served open faced, the Grilled Gorgonzola and Fig on Sourdough ($10) also made an excellent choice with my wine selection.

For lighter fare, Centro offers a handful of generously sized salads. Prosciutto & Shaved Parmesan ($10), with its mixed greens, shaved prosiutto and parmesan, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, was balanced and fresh. Getting a similar balsamic treatment, the Caprese Salad ($10) has slices of fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil, then gets a nice drizzle of olive oil.

Centro is all about the pressed sandwiches or panini, with a dozen to choose from. The Chicken Panini ($10.50) was meaty and tender, with its marinated grilled chicken breast cooked perfectly. Adorning this sandwich were roasted red peppers, stringy fresh mozzarella, roasted tomato, baby arugula and pesto mayo.

Essentially a grilled cheese, Lulu's Press ($9) may sound ordinary, but the Vermont yellow, white cheddar, jack cheese and tomato were all top quality you could taste.

After tasting the tomato sauce on the Chicken Parmesan Panini ($10.50), I felt it was a little too sweet, though that's as bad as the food gets at Centro.

My favorite of the evening was the Roast Beef Panini ($10.50). Thinly sliced roast beef, roasted red peppers, provolone, baby arugula, dijon mustard and a creamy horseradish just popped with flavor. I would order this one again.

Dessert comes in only one choice, Tiramisu ($7.50), but after a two-hour dinner we called it a night and skipped this one.

At the end of a review I ask myself: Would I ever go back? Who could say no to such tasty food?

"Usted es el bocadillo ms hermoso! .".. roughly translated.. you are the most beautiful sandwich!

While this place is in a transitional neighborhood don't let the homeless fool you.. its really tasty! The service is very friendly and it's so cheap you can have a great taco lunch for under 5 bucks!

Let's get to the nitty gritty.. first torta I had from here the "La Presa" couldn't be finished.. not even by my portliness! Its 2 thick pieces of telera topped with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and egg. This torta's HUGE, seriously! Most come with potato chips though ask for the salad instead. Its a serving of shredded lettuce, cabbage, sliced radishes, half a caramelized onion and a roasted jalapeo. IMHO, makes for a balance but really, you can't balance this out but the thought is there!

Alambre de Res burro, tacos and quesadillas have claimed major rock star status with me! Tender chopped beef, bell peppers, onions and melted cheese.. I think they use a little bacon fat too 'cause these bad boi's are bursting with flavor! Ah, gawd!

The fresh juice they make here can also pass for a wonderful lunch substitute. I like the granola, strawberry and pineapple licuado! A meal in itself!

They take your plastic card too! Just go for it!

So low carbin' is all Ive been talking about lately and Im working on creating a new list with my recommendations. 

It might seem like a taco/torta shop is the last place you can low carb but Los Reyes is exceptional, especially on the cheap! Order the Tacos Alambre de Res ($4.75) and have them hold the tortillas.. so what you get is a plate full of chopped beef, onions, bacon all covered in melted cheese served with shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, sliced cucumbers, grilled onion and a grilled jalapeno. Slather on some salsa and don't eat the grilled onion and you've got yourself some good eating right there!

Not to bad.. not to bad at all.. you know me and chain restaurants don't get along very well. So when I was invited here by a friend I had already made up my mind not to hate this place but let it suck on its own. 

I ordered the Smokey Jack Panini based on my friends recommendation. Crunch toasted bread.. smokey bacon and turkey.. guacamole and tomatoes.. what else could top this off, a slice of pepper jack cheese. It didn't fucking suck!  Now the free ice cream, that sucked! 

Might try it again for the salad bar.. looked very fresh and well stocked.

Pita Jungle is my gold standard for Mediterranean food. Sure, it's more fusion than authentic, but the food is amazing, the portions are huge, and the prices are fantastic.

Every single time I come here, I get the Hummus with Chicken. They make hands down the best hummus I've ever had. It's smooth, creamy, with just the right balance of tahini, garlic, and garbanzo beans. They serve it with delicious hot, chewy pitas, and top it with a whole lot of roasted, spiced chicken and pine nuts. Outstanding.

Their other obvious Greek choices are damn good as well. The baba ganoosh is beautifully roasted and mashed, with just a bit of spiciness to it. The falafel is perfectly fried, without being burned or soggy, and richly flavored with cumin and chickpeas. The taboule is absolutely stellar and brightly flavored with parsley and lemon.

The pizzas and pita wraps are all pretty large, especially for the price. They offer a fair diversity of pre-arranged combos: everything from a philly cheesesteak pita (for the less adventurous) to a chipotle chicken lavosh pizza. There are salads and pastas as well, also presenting a mix of Mediterranean cuisine with more familiar flavors. Personally, I love the pizzas and end up ordering one about every time I go, my favorite being the glazed chicken lavosh pizza.

Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here. Everything is fresh, healthy, delicious, and enormous. Even the daily specials have nearly always been wonderful (barring a poorly executed attempt at Tikka Masala). The wide diversity of the menu means that even people who don't care for Greek food will be able to find something enjoyable. But, the high quality of food also means those people may end up changing their minds.

Depending on how much you like this place, you could describe it as either a rip-off of or an improvement to the Chipotle model of dishing out sort-of Mexican food. Personally, I think it's a wash: Costa Vida does a few things better and a few things worse.

At Costa Vida, you have the option of ordering hard tacos, a burrito, a bowl, or nachos. Once you've decided the basic configuration, the real fun begins. You pick one of four meats, one of two different beans, one or more of the numerous salsas, and whatever you want of the standard toppings. They really pile things on here, which is a definite plus, and that makes the food here a pretty good deal. On the other hand, not all the options are wonderful. The tacos are noticeably smaller portions than the other options and the chips in the nachos often turn to mush under the wetter toppings. Of the salsas, several are tasty, but none of them appropriately spicy. But, that may actually appeal to you.

I think what's going to make it or break it for you with Costa Vida is how well you like the much lauded sweet pork. Everything else at Costa Vida is pretty unadventurous and safe; the sweet pork is really what sets this place apart. Basically, it's slow cooked pork, shredded up in a very sweet reduction that I would bet money is made out of a cola. The meat is very tender, but I found the sauce to be rather cloying, almost syrupy. I've heard it described as being like a dessert, and I don't think that is very far off. Some people love it, but I couldn't do it. It was just too sweet and an odd complement to the cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, etc. To me, it the sweet pork seems like a better fit for a Southern restaurant. 

If it sounds like you may like this sweet pork, give the place a shot. There is often a big line to get food, but this is an efficiency kitchen and they handle rushes with aplomb. I found the dining area awfully loud and uncomfortably packed, but the seating outside alleviates most of that. Still, it's a little hectic for me, especially since I'm not impressed by the food. Get it to go or sit outside, that's my advice.

Grimaldi's has one of the best perks for your birthday!

If you are on the email list, you will get an email a little before your birthday, which can be used before or after within a few days! It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza! 

This essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!

I enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!

Service was pretty slow during lunchtime at the bar.  They only had one server for the entire bar area, AND she had tables in the dining area.  Not a huge deal to me since I wasn't in a hurry that day, but keep it in mind in case this wasn't an "off" day for them.

I'll be back at some point, but for sure next year for my birthday!

Will be hard to beat this place for a great dog at a great price...

Not only are the dogs juicy and packed with flavor, but the toppings aim for the stars.

Tried the Bulgogi dog, and it was an incredible combination.  I love good hotdogs, and I love bulgogi....(had it last night actually) but when combined, it is a match made well.

My friend and I also shared two orders of fries...everyone said to try the angry kimchi fries or whatever they are called, and the European fries....results?

The kim chee fries were nothing out of the ordinary for me...I am a fan of sweet potato fries, and I absolutely love great kim chee, but the combination of SP fries and kim chee didn't mesh for me.  I still ate it, but it was not mind blowing.  I would see myself eating the items separately, vs together in each bite.

However, that garlic mayo and herb sauce spread onto the European fries?  OMG this was one of the best things ever!  One of my favorite combinations of french fries ever consumed....this was the highlight of lunch!  The pork belly slivers doesn't hurt either!  But trust me, I will order this just for the sauce....amazing!

Prices are pretty fair for the food, and besides my bread coming out slightly hard/stale (not sure if grilled or just old), I have no issues and will be back for more!

From the time when she still sold at La Grande Orange to Roosevelt to Central to the Old Town Farmer's Market to Vincent's Camelback Market I've made my rounds on the Tammie Coe collection and thus far have found no difference in quality from place to place and as such my review is the same for each.

Items experienced thus far include:  Snickerdoodle, Chocolate Pumpkin Muffin, Maple Bacon Scone, Ooey Gooey, Red Velvet, Dark Cocoa Caramel Ooey Gooey, Carrot Cake, Blackberry Bran Muffin, Portobello Tart, Cinnamon Roll, Plum Streusel Brioche, Almond Butter Pastry, Tammie Coe Butterscotch Crumb Bun, MJ Flourless Chocolate cookie, Tammie Coe "Betters" Cookie, Tammie Coe Blueberry Coconut Tart.

Trained from a young age, first by family and later formally, and known by both those who are interested in the culinary arts and those who simply have money to spend on a beautiful wedding or birthday cake I first experienced Tammie's pastry during my interview trip to Phoenix when her goods were still on display at La Grande Orange and as good as her oft raved cupcakes (which I'm told are comparable in texture and flavor to her famous designer cakes) are it is three of her less 'famous' items that make her pastry, in my opinion, 'destination worthy' - the Streusel Brioche a sort of portable French Toast hand Pie with a custard center and bruleed top, the Almond Butter Pastry a dense baton coated thick with confectioners' sugar and a texture somewhere between a buttermilk biscuit and a croissant, an finally the incomparable Crumb Bun whose swirls of sugar shellacked pastry peel away like that of a cinnamon roll with a texture akin to a Kouign Amann only to reveal pockets of rich butterscotch streusel...

...and yeah, those ooey gooey cupcakes aren't too shabby either - a perfect cake:frosting ratio that, although very sweet at first, gradually reveals the tang of the cream cheese leading to balance - and for those who'd prefer something less sweet I'll also vouch for the impressively moist muffins or the truly inspired tart; a sort of Italian style macaroon meets blueberry muffin.

Items Selected:

Carrot Cake
French Toast
Cheese Blintzes with Big Apple Sauce
Coffee

Located inside The Mirage, 24-hour New York staple Carnegie Deli had long been one of those restaurants I figured I would 'eventually' patronize - the menu featuring a few items of interest but the Las Vegas Boulevard upcharge seemingly unjustified by 'deli food,' no matter how good - an early morning breakfast finally sparked by a group of friends staying at the hotel and the result a good time with surprisingly good food despite prices I'd still label exorbitant.  Bringing the signature 7th street delicatessen to a surprisingly small space just off the gaming floor where a few trios and quartets sat basking in the glow of the prior night's escapades behind enormous sandwiches and cauldrons of matzo ball soup it was to friendly service and overhead Sinatra that we arrived and seated immediately orders followed in an equally expedited manner, a total of perhaps nine items ordered but my focus on three plus a half-dozen refills to my cup of coffee.  Speaking first to my favorite 'appetizer,' the $8.50 slice of carrot cake proved competent and not overly sweet, but perhaps as a result of our early morning visit and a cake from last night the crumb delivered slightly dry and under-spiced - the impressive cream cheese icing thankfully buoying the dish, though none of it nearly as impressive as the $13.95 fried cheese blintzes whose light eggy tones and balanced parts savory meets sweet proved excellent on their own, yet far better with house-made applesauce taken bite-for-bite.  Eschewing  meats or omelets, though all looked good, it was in a Jewish deli's Challah that I placed my trust for a 'main course' and with three thick slices soaked in batter, fried golden in butter, and drowned in maple syrup I really could not have asked for more, the stack a veritable bargain at $10.95.

my home (well one of em, the other one is palazzo lol) away from home. i love the venetian, same goes for palazzo. i feel like out of all the hotels i've stayed at over the years, this one is the nicest: great rooms (all of them are suites), great customer service, and a great location (plus getting the room comped makes it 1000 times better :])

the rooms are all set up the same. when you walk in there's a good size bathroom: a seperate shower and bath, two sinks, a bathroom, and a make up station :] WITH a tv which is great when you're getting ready or taking a bath :]

when you walk in you either get 2 queens or 1 king. there's a closet and yet again another tv. then theres a few stairs to the "living room" with couch (pull out bed) and 2 desks and yet another tv haha.

i would recommend everyone and anyone to stay here. it's a great place to stay and there's a bunch of things to do! you can seriously be happy staying at venetian and never stepping outside! (since it's connected to palazzo) also on the 2nd floor there's shopping and restaurants (connected to palazzo's shopping and restaurants as well). i've never been shopping there since i come to vegas to eat, party, drink, and GAMBLE!!! but the restaurants are great (well the one's i've been to) i've been to wolf gang puck's bistro, first food & bar, and sushi samba. all which are great (read my reviews!!!) also venetian is home of TAO night club and palazzo is home of LAVO. when staying at venetian and you want to check out tao, just stay in the invited guests line (takes about 10 mins) which is for guests staying at the hotel. 

another plus very close to fashion mall, mirage, bellagio, encore, wynn, and treasure island...also harrahs (carnival court FTW!) and imperial palace (ginseng 3, hash house a go go, and fat tuesdays yay!!!)

next time you need somewhere to stay pick the venetian...or palazzo you will thank me later :]

I don't think I will be staying at the MGM again. They always mess up my reservation and when they messed up my reservation for my bachelorette party that was the last straw! We booked a queen suite attached to a regular queen room and the paranoid person I am...I called multiple times to confirm this because I had 10 girls and we all wanted to be together. I arrive Friday at 9 AM only to find out that there are no more queen suites available...I was SO UPSET. They told me that it was first come first serve...WTF I RESERVED 2 ROOMS AND WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT I WANTED AND PAID FOR IT! After a hour of waiting they finally came up with something: a king suite attached to a queen room -_- We took it because we had no choice and some of the girls slept on the couch and a couple on the floor...to make things worse they didn't even give us a cheaper rate! SO LAME. 

MGM will definitely not be my first choice in the future...this experience made me not want to come back!

I did get a bit tipsy and I did have a great time talking with Arturo and my gf! He is so helpful with the types of drinks too. He gave us the details on each tequila and told us what was hot and what was not. 

He introduced my to some expensive ass tequila called Ansom Broso which was anejo and cost $125 a shot!!!! Holy crap! He even gave me a swig of the tequila azul which cost $25 a shot! He is legit I tell you.

If you ever visit TI and drink through ISLA, I suggest coming around 12 am and having Arturo as your personal dude.

About the Brand/products (copy and paste this for each location, location specific comments below the line)

I LOVE teas and really enjoy teavana. Prices will seem high at first but there's such varied prices from $3- $25 for a 2oz bag that there's a tea for every price range and a style for each person from fruity to herbal and many premium "traditional" blends, yerba mates (caffeine as much as coffees) and 0 caffeine teas for those who can't have caffeine. It goes a long way in whatever teas you get as the 2oz makes for many servings (about 2 teaspoons makes a full teapot for me....probably 20 times) - many teas you can even double steep with no problems as it is quality, flavorful leaves. 

 Even with getting my teas worth out of leaves, people ask me all the time though "why would you pay $18 for your green tea here?" Open up a cheapo tea bag- it's like dust in it....its the dregs of leaves from processing is gathered and are sold as more affordable accessible tea bags. You can taste the flavor difference in quality, drinking bags and leaves side by side. The way I look at all enjoyable, finer things in life- do you want the good stuff or the left overs? It really isnt that much..by ounces of tea the leaves make it comes out about the same as "gourmet tea bags" per cost of ounce. I did the math! It's the same or a little bit more (LOL I'm funny like that, but people ask so often I wanted to KNOW I'm right). Also some people dont realize how hard some teas are to cultivate. It's a BITCH! I read books about tea, tea is one of my hobbies. Simply the work (imagine hand rolling jasmine pearl teas! imagine climbing the mountain side to hand pick baby tea leaves to make white tea) and love make this a beautiful thing worth it's price. People pay for things like bourbon,craft beers (my other drink passion), but not teas which is more a manual labor of love ? 

If you also just want a cup of tea they can brew it for you in store- prices vary by tea but a good way to sample some of the pricier teas. There are many free samples around the store too. I get the German Rock Sugar...some people think it's a waste, but for some of the delicate white teas this is perfect, light sweetening. Ice teas and dessert teas though- I just use organic raw turbinado sugar or Australian Honey for a stronger sweetener. Do not put white sugar, they'll tell you this too because it does overpower a lot of teas and the chemicals ruins some tea flavors to alter.

Tea accessories- some of the decorative pots are beautiful, but pricey. I love what I have of theirs though. Perfect TeaMaker is a great simple brewing vessel. For show we have a glass teapot for here too. What I love though is the double walled glass tea tumblers. Never gets hot or cold in your hand from the drink. I have small and big ones and I use the big ones even for beer.

I've turned many people onto teas because of this place. I patron a few tea shops in LA, but this place i definitely more "accessible"...price and variety wise. I appreciate they are taking quality mainstream.

A few people were very obvious that they were selling but I can tell they were new too so can't really dock down for that, they're learning how to get into the "groove". I've been in retail and it doesn't come natural to a lot of people. Staff overall is very pleasant and seem to enjoy their job (Teavana treats their employees well- my friend works at a Cali location). Samples are pretty ample here and encouraging about trying things. Fairly spacious store and neat.

As I got more knowledgeable on where to source teas I found that Teavana has been a bit more on the costly side. I guess considering its a store front compared to some companies that deal online or through supplying boutiques/natural grocers it's a bit understandable. I go for more flavored type teas here and buy some of the finer varieties elsewhere as the quality has also been better on those for the price (IE jasmine pearls which I love). I still like that Teavana introduces a lot of people to loose leaf tea as it's accessible to most and has variety.

The thing that changed my mind about this place is the attitude of the customer service. It's friggin tea being sold at a skeevy used car sales upsell and high pressure. They make commission but that shouldn't make service suffer to try to get more sales. I've been in sales jobs with quotas and making a person feel they are being squeezed isn't the way to go. 

I want two ounces of this tea. "Is 3.8 ounces okay?" NO. That's double what I asked for. If I like it, I'll come back. I just want a small quantity of new teas. 

Even if I'm buying a few items and said there is nothing else, they still are relentless. Do you need a tea maker? What about mugs? A travel cup? Sugar? Honey sticks? Tea bags? Would you buy my soul? 

This isn't a isolated incident. It's happened a few times I've been in and my visits get less because of it. My fiance has complained about this the past few times he's been to this location and other locations. 

I drink tea daily so I could be a really good customer if I was just treated as not dollar signs and sales quota. I think I can live without setting foot in Teavana from now on. There's a wonderful mom and pop tea shop on the SE side of town and a few online purveyors to fill my needs.

I guess they opened one in Henderson on Eastern by the 215.  I usually don't eat at a newly opened restaurant but my partner wanted to try it out.  I am a fan of sushi so who am I to complain.  You can tell that they were still getting all the kinks out with their servers.  Our server, actually confessed she isn't a connoisseur of sushi so she doesn't know what they look like.  I was like "Really?"  Why would you be a server if you don't know what you are serving?  We ordered our food and was not happy with the service.  We didn't order AYCE so I expected our food to come at the same time.  My partner got his sushis and I was left without any food.   I ordered a bento box that came with miso soup and salad.  They didn't bring the soup until I asked about it.  Don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good, most of all the grilled BBQ salmon that came with my bento box.  The thing that really somewhat made the experience unpalatable was the service.  They need to work out the kinks and I am sure the grade for this establishment will be higher.

If you are looking for an Asian grocery store, then there you go.  This place is as Asian as it can get.  From the fresh produce to the meats and seafood, this place just oozes Asian cuisine.  I also like that they carry specialties from the Philippines like lumpia, Magnolia ice cream, and other Filipino staples.  Their prices are very reasonable too.  With the produce I bought there, other places would have cost me twice the amount.  I have to say, this is a nice place to shop when you are in the mood for Asian cuisine at home.  The only gripe I have it's a bit dirty and somewhat smells.  But if you have been to other Asian grocery stores, you should be used to it.

Perhaps the greatest Little Middle Eastern market & restaurant in the valley! The Hummus & Lebni are to DIE FOR, the Lamb is out of this world and the Feta cheese may be the freshest I have ever experienced. My favorite Med. cuisine location by far. I love that I can Buy everything I have just eaten at the market next door and prepare it at home as well. Only One Issue, PARKING IS TERRIBLE during busy hours.  This is a MUST SEE for anyone seeking this type of cuisine! GO NOW!  P.S. Dont  know why this review shows up in 2 places, oh well this place is worth it!

I was reading the review for this airport and had the feeling that some were written by PR firms!

I hate this airport! It is inefficient, badly organize and the transport links makes Montreal looks worst that developing countries.

It seems that the security and Canadian customs are manage to optimize their own resource without the slightest care about the passengers.

Seriously, they made a big investment on the building in the last few years and expanded Canadian custom hall quite a bit... BUT they don't staff it. Schedule plane service landed every day about the same time, can't you staff the place so people don't have to wait an hour or more for immigration? Apparently not. Canada is also the only place I know where citizen and permanent residents don't have a priority line (you know because citizen can be cleared faster and you can clear the place?).

The train line that go to downtown is less than a mile away, but there is no convenient train service to downtown and they have been taking about a rail link to the terminal for over 40 years... nothing

Can this place be made efficient and serve it's function well? Yes. Does it do so now? No, absolutely not.

I love In-N-Out... They have my favorite burger of all the burgers I've had... Originally being from southern California, I may be biased about it, but Double-Doubles are so amazing... And I eat a lot of burgers in a lot of places. 

The sweetness of the sauce compliments the saltiness of the patties, contrasts the mildness of the cheese, compliments the crispness of the lettuce/tomato, contrasts the chewiness of the buns...

The fries are great too. Not overly crisp, not soggy, lightly salted, fried in vegetable oil, and cut to order. 

They just stick to what they know and what the do well. Not over complicating the menus and keeping it simple. (even the "secret menu")

3 stars isn't meant to be an insult. It just means that... Well... Nothing really blew me away... 

The service was friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant. I had a nice and quiet bar all to myself sipping on my coffee and orange juice to nurse my hang over.

I had the Duck Hash and Eggs.  It was good.  Great even. I'll definitely repeat while staying at the Wynn, but it's just... I dunno... Everything in Vegas feels fake to me, and this is just one of those times where I feel if this restaurant was anywhere else, I would be more likely to rate them higher.

Definitely repeatable while staying at the hotel though...

I don't recommend this place if you are a vegetarian or health conscious.  (And neither does the restaurant represent itself as being vegetarian or health friendly.)

The bacon jam tasted good but visually was not appealing due to its blackish color (and even a little gross because it was marinating in its fat).

The lamb in the gyros were dried out, so much so that even the yogurt sauce didn't cover up the dryness. The pita bread was moist and tasty though, and I have to wonder whether this would do better as a vegetarian dish.

The two dishes I really enjoyed were the Cuban (although did it really need to be pork belly?) and the mac and cheese. Both were flavorful and moist.

However, I can't in good conscious give more than 3 stars since this was only half the dishes, and I can't imagine the calories cost to achieve those flavors.  I can't ignore that the mac and cheese probably was a very fattening dish (so much so that one of my fellow diners could not finish the small dish). I can't ignore that the Cuban had 2 very thick slices of cheese on 2 buttered slices of toast. Just because I choose to eat out doesn't mean I want to eat a more than 1000 calorie meal. If I wanted that, I'd have gone to Heart Attack down the street.

Definitely an impressive restaurant. The most attractive thing about this restaurant is that they make their pasta fresh daily! 

Dark and classy the menu has options for everyone.  Outside seating area available. So here's what I ordered . . . The caprese, I am very traditional and its just something that you can't get wrong . . . Loved it!  Then the server came over with a selection of the freshly made pasta options. Nice presentation, always impressive . . . I went with the ravioli option . . . The best! Yes!

We took our largest business partner to this location because we knew, the food would be great, the service would be great and the experience would be memorable.

Side bar . . . One server always remembers me!! I really like it . . . Makes me look forward to going back!!!

Great place for a business dinner, special occasion, romantic night out.

I normally love this place, but for me the service drives a significant part of my rating especially when the food is consistently good. 

We walk in with a large party for a special occasion. We made reservations, but apparently an error was made with the seating and they split our party up in to two tables. I politely said . . . This happened before, and we pushed the additional tables together . . .  The server says loudly in my ear "WE CANT DO THAT"  Long story short . . . He was rude and he was not willing to accommodate any special requests (he wouldn't even consider asking the chef). We work for one of the largest companies in the area (if not the largest) and we represented the leadership team for that location . . . We used to frequent the restaurant, but I think that will change as everyone was annoyed at this waiter. 

Tall big guy dark hair, didn't ask his name again because he had such an attitude problem and he put a damper on our special celebration.

Marcellinos, you have too good of a restaurant to allow that kind of behavior. I would recommend this restaurant, as they make fresh pasta daily and have a nice menu, but if you see a guy that looks like Penn from Penn and Teller without the ponytail, but his hair is slicked back . . . Ask for someone else, seriously.

I like this place. Small but comfortable. My colleagues and I went there for a quick lunch. They have a power lunch menu which has a balanced selection of items. Power lunch suggests quick preparation and delivery to your table . . . They did a nice job!!

I ordered the bistro steak over a salad . . . Flavors were amazing and I absolutely loved the raspberry vinegarette. My colleagues ordered a kale salad with a side of salmon and seemed very happy with their choice. One of our colleagues is a "meat and potatoes" kind of guy and ordered a sandwich that he did not eat. The server quickly came over and asked him if everything was ok. He also asked if he could get him something else. The sandwich looked amazing, but our colleague is a very finicky eater. The server removed the sandwich from the bill. I loved the way the server handled it, he seemed genuinely concerned. I love great customer service! 

Great service and the food had very nice flavors. It was quick and delicious.

I highly recommend Upton for a nice lunch and creative menu.

3.5 stars.

Pros:

- Modern upscale decor, clean restaurant inside despite how it looks outside
- Awesome bar area
-Food is good, nothing spectacular. Not very authentic Viet but that doesn't bother me too much. 
-Big servings

Cons:

-Inefficient staff (seem very inexperienced in the business, kept forgetting our orders and never wrote them down, didn't bring our drink orders and if they did forgot to refill drinks) but i guess they were friendly
-Food is good, nothing spectacular
-wish there were more items on the menu

 FOOD ITEMS: 

-Beef BBQ spring rolls- they take a different twist on it and add avocado, lettuce and hoison sauce marinated beef but its probably my favorite thing on the menu

- Lettuce wraps- chicken, baby shrimp and glass noodles (you know the korean kind) and peanuts for the mix and slices of lettuce served with a the sweet-fish sauce-chili concoction. I had a hard time wrapping this in the lettuce so I ate it on its own and took a bite of lettuce lol. Seriously, it was just like stir fried noodles. 

-Pho- Mehhh. I used to live a few miles from Little Saigon so I've tasted good Pho. I would call this broth very bland. However the noodles are cooked al dente and the beef is standard so I would come back here again for it if I was craving pho and didnt want to drive too far. 2.5 out of 5 at most. 

- Crispy noodle- this is a popular egg noodle dish that I don't see at a lot of Viet restaurants here but its pretty good. You get a huge portion. It has meat and vegetables and the sauce reminds me of chop-suey but the noodles are the crispy kind. I would order this again. 

Will continue to come back and try other items and because I like the decor and overall vibe. Hopefully the staff will improve and they will add to the menu. And that they make better pho.

Catching up on reviews! My husband and I visited WS during March Madness. I went into this experience as a Doubting Thomas, and I was not disappointed. Let me explain. I have NEVER been to a buffet that I liked. Something about them just...grosses me out. And the food is never quite right: not hot enough, overdone--you know the drill. But I figured that if ANYONE could do a buffet right, it was LAS VEGAS. Wicked Spoon was "up there" among the Las Vegas Buffet Glitterati. So the hubby and I waited through a moderate line to pony up. As we stood there, my husband was on TRIP ADVISOR--I KNOW, I KNOW: crime against humanity!--and found a recent review wherein, a disgruntled customer reported having found a MAGGOT in her DESSERT. I will admit that this thought nagged at the back of my mind throughout the meal. 

That aside, the layout was impressive. BUT the food failed to deliver. The chicken teriyaki I snagged from the line was just adorable, served as it was in a cute little pan--but it was not especially tasty and was quite cold. The crab legs were positively PUNY. The dedicated seafood chef made Bouillabaisse while I waited: how cool is THAT? But the seafood was overcooked, and the dish completely missed the mark.

I skipped dessert.

Bottom line: WS offers TONS of food in a glittering, breathtaking array. But NONE of it is that good. Skip it.

Restaurant review
I am glad that I am back by Za's after moving back to Champaign. This was my favorite place to eat at on campus when I was a medical student. Now that I am back I have found out that there are multiple locations which works out well. The prices are actually cheaper than when I was here for college due to a modification in the menu. For the pasta you get to select from multiple types and sauces with 4 toppings for 5 dollars. The premium protein items i.e shrimp, meatballs, chicken will run you a dollar more each. The food is prepared quickly, however I don't know if they changed it now to use a convection oven/microwave to nuke your toppings which is one down side. This is then added to a pan with the sauce and served quickly. You also get a nice piece of garlic bread. All and all this is better than McD and for the same price. There are also other options such as pizza, salads, sandwiches etc. I have never strayed from the pasta

Pro: inexpensive, quick, large portions

Cons: microwaved toppings (i guess you get what you pay for)

Hidden gem:
Sign up for the perka app. You need to check in and tell the cashier so they can give you the punch to earn free food. I did not realize this and ended up not getting my first check-in. You can't just check-in which makes sense or people would abuse the system

Have you ever played resident evil... This is how awesome the capitol looks when it is empty. I had no idea that you can enter capitol buildings during early morning hours with no one around. The gothic architecture is amazing and the halls echo to the sound of a pin dropping. I saw people singing in the different halls with there voice echoing throughout. The coolest thing is the setting reminds me of the city hall in RE 1. I had more fun here than I thought!

We arrived shortly after 8:30pm to realized they closed at 9:00.  No worries as they were quick to say, "Come on in!"

Prior to our arrival we didn't know if Green was a sit-down or counter service.  Upon entering we found that it would be a counter service experience.  Nice and laid back. I immediately loved the flow of the restaurant with the painted wooden tables along with tree stumps for some of the seats.  Patio dining is available but the far end also has a see-through garage door that can be opened up for open air dining too.

Quick examination of the menu had me wanting everything.  It's so nice not to have to decipher which items are vegan and which ones aren't.  I settled on the Mexicali Burger.  However, when I went to order I noticed the special...."The Big Wac".  What?!  This is what everyone has been talking about in the Green Facebook Group. You see, The Big Wac is basically the vegan version of the Big Mac.  It's not always available and absolutely everyone was raving about it.  I made the quick switch, ordered the Big Wac with fries and my husband ordered the Kung Pao bowl.

Did the Big Wac live up to the rave reviews? Yes, and more! Although I admit I was never a huge burger person even prior to going veg this may be one of the best burgers I've had in my life.  Seriously.  My husband's meal was also tasty but after a nibble of my burger he immediately wished he had gone for the Big Wac too. Partnered with the yummy thin fries I had the perfect meal.

I can't wait to return to have another fantastic meal!

We've only been to Pittsburgh twice and we've visited this place both times. I mean, a church converted into a brewery?! That's just awesome. 

I greatly enjoyed sitting a pew and drinking a beer, plus every beer I've tried has been great: the first time I visited I chose a red ale and the second time I tried their winter ale, plus I tried my partner's tripel belgian and our friend's IPA.

On our second visit I ordered a zucchini pasta dish, which was spiraled zucchini with mushroom lentil falafel-like balls and tomato sauce, it was pretty good, but way too salty and they should seriously cut back on the amount of salt they use in that dish. If I were reviewing just my dish, I would give 3 stars, but since the concept is so cool and the beer is great, 4 is fair. We also ordered pita and hummus and that was delicious.

I'd definitely go back.

I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure! Usually sushi bars have a very boring decor and bland music but this place was playing Trance music.. that is awesome! with beautiful decor to the wall art and the exposed pipes it has a very stylish/modern feel to it. I almost felt like I was in San Francisco. 
I ordered the seaweed salad. It was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. The seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used.
Then i ordered the Hawaiian roll with soy paper. It had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a Cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. Seriously one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had and I consider myself a sushi connoisseur. 
Next time I'm there I will defiantly get the all you can eat. for $25 its well worth it. 
Why only 4 stars? horrible service, I sat at a table and had a difficult time ordering and keeping my water glass filled. but whatever the food was so great Ill defiantly  recommend it.

The popcorn scallops are amazing as well. they're little scallops deep fried and served with a wasabi ranch and honey mustard sauce. 
I had the all you can eat which was only $25 and that even included 2 oysters! Amazing deal especially for the quality. Ive already been 3 times in the past 3 days and Ill probably end up here at least 3-4 times a week. LOVE LOVE LOVE!

Oh! and the sushi chefs are awesome. :)

We have been patrons of Pet Club for quite some time. While this location does not seem quite as big as some of the others, they still carry a wide variety of goodies that are sure to make any pampered pooch (or cat!) very happy. Being that both of our pets are on a holistic and grain-free diet, Pet Club is an obvious choice for their food needs. They carry a wide variety of foods that are difficult to find in the big chains. At the risk of sounds like a pet-owning snob, I appreciate that these stores carry plenty of foods that don't include the yucky stuff most people don't want to know is in their pet's food. The employees are knowledgeable about the products they carry and the items are reasonably priced.

This restaurant has become a lunch favorite at my work. It has great food (their yellow curry is fantastic), wonderful customer service and reasonable prices. If I had to critique anything, it would be their location. They are located in the huge shopping center that used to house Basha's and Target...now empty. It is somewhat of a ghost town but don't be fooled! This is a family owned restaurant that you will be glad you visited.

I have had mostly good experiences at EVO and one that was very disappointing.

On several occasions, we have enjoyed either happy hour or dinner. The food is tasty and I appreciate the vegetarian options. Most of the time, the service is good. The one time exception that I have not been able to push from my memory was for a friend's birthday party. We were a party of 14 and from the beginning, the night was a mess. It took 20 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink orders (without much of an apology.) I ordered the vegetable risotto which came out 30 minutes after everyone had received their food. I essentially ate by myself and when the house manager came over to make amends, he gave two other people refills on their drinks. It was very strange and while I have not experienced anything like that since, it bumped EVO down on my list.

This place is brand new. it is a market and a great place for lunch. 

My review is for lunch only. 

Gyro $5.99
Fry's and drink $2.50
Total $9.22

The place is clean and has plenty of help. Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. 

The food was average, the pita was warm and the gyro meat was good. It is cooked on a spit. The tzatziki sauce was thin and not too flavorful. I have had better. 
Fries were a thicker type and had a little seasoning on them. They give enough for two to share. 

The salads looked good as did the "plate" types of meals . 

I will go back but may skip the fries and drink.

The dinning area looks like a dump and appears more like the back of  a low class medical center(white medical style tiles) but dont let that scare you.

They are serving some great Chinese Food and even some above average Sushi.

We shared the Godzilla Roll and it was delicious.  Not a lot of rice filer and the spicy tuna was fresh and flavorful.

For my dinner I had the shrimp Lo Mien and asked for it to be a little spicy. It was awesome but could have used a few more shrimp and vegetables. Still think its in my top two or three for Lo Mien in Vegas

The daughter loved her beef broccoli and is looking forward to leftovers tomorrow night.

If you live near by its worth the stop in.

JR was the finest meal of my life. In fact, from start to finish I felt like a princess. We were collected at The Bellagio in a gold limousine. Perfect. Taken through the private gated entrance. 

Everything was perfection. This sets the bar for the finest dining experience of my life.

I now want all desserts presented on a dessert cart.

Joel, if I could leave you 100 star review, that would be more accurate. This continues to be my favorite. From the minute you are collected in the gorgeous gold car, it feels like a different world. 

You enter via the gated entry and it is absolutely stunning. The private garden is breathtaking. The entry is quiet and understated. 

Our last visit was in the walled patio and we loved it. This time, we had a comfortable corner booth and it was a surprisingly different experience. We could watch smooth and seamless serving presentations and delight of other diners. It was much more entertaining and engaging. The service is perfection and it's lovely to see how this is achieved. 

As for the food and wine, it is simply spectacular!  

The chilled lobster in a refreshing light sweet sour sauce was my favorite dish of the night. Three stunning pyramids of lobster in a light glaze. 

We were able to try parts of the brilliant vegetarian menu as well. We all tried the perfectly poached egg with a light spinach and cheese sauce. Perfect with the bacon bread. 

For my main dish, I decided on the the lobster and it was so perfect, it actually made me giddy. That and the two glasses of champagne....

We also tried the rich and complex rib eye with bone marrow and perfectly prepared black cod. Everything is so expertly prepared that each element is breathtaking. The warm dishes come out in glass domes. Each dish arrives and is presented at the correct temperature. The mashed potatoes are so smooth and silky, they melt in your mouth. 

The stunning desserts all all presented in a unique and magical way. I had the chocolate and cherry extravaganza and it was a work of art. It looks like a colorful magic mushroom in a sideways wine glass on a square plate of gold Murano glass. There were tiny green "moss" covered balls that are actually steeped cherries. Underneath the mushroom are crispy buttery cookie bits. All of the desserts are spectacular and delicious but the cherry mushroom is out of this world!

The bread cart is beautiful and each bread is unique and bold. Everything is so unusual and so beautiful. They bring the bread cart around frequently and are happy to bring anything you could possibly want. There is also a wonderful domed butter and olive oil for the wonderful breads. We tried as many as possible.

We are all dessert fanatics and the dessert cart made three trips to our table. Only when we couldn't possible eat another bite, dinner came to a close. There are beautiful tiny tarts like jewels, chocolates and jellies of every imaginable kind. Even tiny pops of chocolate and marshmallow. Amazing.

The charming chef greeted us and we were able to fawn over his skills. Before we left we were presented with gift bags with tea cake. Everything and anything you could possibly think of. Almost three hours later, we made our way, winding through the Baccarat tables and beautiful art work. There was a tray, with more champagne, while we waited for our car. 

This is a beautiful and unique experience. I love the elegant dining room room with a bit of whimsy and drama to make remind you, you're still in "over the top" Las Vegas.

I can't wait for our next visit. This is a spectacular experience and you will remember it forever.

Hooray, another good Indian place opened up in the SW Valley to replace the late, lamented Sutra!

I've been going there for some time, but haven't wanted to review it after my Sutra jinx. Now they've been open for a while and always seem to be doing a brisk business.

I really like this place. Immediate, friendly service, good food, great prices. 

As some have mentioned, the buffet can be a bit limited at times, particularly if you're looking for a 100% vegetarian meal. I'd skip the buffet and order from the menu. Favorites include vegetable and paneer pakora, aloo gobhi (spiced as you like it), and bismati rice. Don't miss their fantastic lassis, served sweet plain or with mango (also served salty, but that doesn't strike me as yummy).

The last time we were there, we went for dinner. The service was terrible, the food was meh, and did I mention the service was terrible? A waiter stood around playing on his phone and watching TV while we sat, waiting far too long for our meals, with empty glasses in front of us. At one point the manager came by, filled our glasses, and said something to the waiter. Then, later, the manager came by again and looked at our empty glasses, then followed the waiter over and watched while he refilled it. Why did we need multiple refills? Because it took so freakin' long to get the food out, that's why. Meanwhile, we're munching on the complimentary salty chickpea things they gave us.

There were only two tables to wait on. We generally only go for lunch, so maybe dinner service is always this bad and that's why there were no customers in the place at 7 pm.  An unfashionable hour to be sure, but it's the west side. 

Oh, and the best table in the place was taken - by the waiter's charging cell phone. Apparently that table is next to a convenient outlet. So we were seated under a TV, which was awesome because it felt like the aforementioned waiter who was watching TV all night was standing there just staring at us.

Also took 15 minutes to get the check at the end of this exercise in excellence.

With service this bad, I'd have given a single star even if the food made my mouth sing. Maybe two. Probably not, though.

Don't let this simple hidden treasure keep you from coming here. This is tucked in a grocery store with authentic spices and cooking for an affordable meal! It's like having street eats! :)
You just grab one of the yellow sheets and mark what you want and then leave it in the basket. The staff will take the order while you sit. Sip on some water while waiting. 
The last time I came here I ordered the Aloo Tikki Chaat. This is vegetarian dish made of the  Tikki (potato patty) made of potatoes, green chili, corn flour, lentils, chili powder and other spices) served with chopped onions, green chutney (spicy sauce), tamarind chutney (sweet sauce) and yogurt.
I also ordered Special #1:  rice pulao (mixed veggie rice), bhatura (equivalent to a Mexican tortilla), matar paneer (cheese-like curds) and pickle (pickled veggies that probably the inexperienced palate will not be able to master). 

These dishes have so many flavors!! Give it a try! :)

For a dinner at the Hyatt Regency this restaurant did me well. It's a swanky place where you can dress for an occasion- as we have seen the next table over celebrate 35 years of marriage! 

A starter menu of mini finger foods to select is given along with the regular menu. Knowing what we all wanted for dinner, we dove in for the entree because we all know that we have to save room for dessert!  The server first asked if we dined with them before and since it was our first time he asked if we had any questions about the menu. I had to ask about the confit crispy duck leg and pan seared duck breast since it is one of my faves. My other to-eat-wish-list item was the baked ziti with braised short rib. I decided to go with the dual duck plate to try the different cooking style. The pan seared duck breast looked like cut slices of a beef filet with a hint taste of liver undertones. Paired with the sweet and sour glaze and toasted pine nuts complemented the taste quite well. Cutting into the crispy confit part was delicious and easy. Biting into the crispness of the skin and soft parts of the meat worked well too. Brussel spouts, pearl onions and other winter vegetables gave an earthy and comfort side to the dish. 

Dessert: knowing me I had to choose the dessert that seem like the not as popular: white chocolate panna cotta. I love panna cotta if made right. This was categorized as rich and decadent! Aka made to share with others. This was presented in a giant saucer looking plate. At first glance it looked like the dessert was missing but it was a small bowl sized dessert with 2 slivers of circle cut honey glazed pear, brown butter whipped cream and bits of dried cut apricot. The texture of the panna cotta itself was thick and creamy. For some reason it had an orange undertone to the panna cotta -which I'm not opposed to because I live oranges. 

The only star that was docked off was my water refill. At the beginning of the meal my water was filled to the rim. By dessert time I didn't get a single refill.

I'm basically copying my review of La Fabrique Arhoma. 

Location: In Place Valois, on Ontario Est... I drove so can't say what subway stop is close-by. Street parking is available but there's a lot of construction in the area so it's a sh*t show.

The place: This space is much bigger than La Fabrique, with the bread section on one side and the rest of the goodies on the other. They also had cheeses and sandwiches. This is a pick-up joint so you can't sit down and eat your goodies.

The goods: I first discovered Arhoma through Lufa, when I ordered a basic white loaf of bread. Holy crap, do these guys make good bread! The loaf has a great consistency and is super tasty. I like a hint of saltiness in my bread and this one totally delivered. A friend of mine swears by their baguettes - I haven't tried them but I'm confident that they rock. I stopped in last weekend because I needed a pick-me-up from walking around, hunting for street art all day. I decided to go for the pistachio chocolatine, which, by the way, is enormous. I guess I lucked out because when I started picking at it, it still had a hint of warmth to it, and the chocolate was all melty. The chocolatine was super, super moist and literally melted in my mouth. I mean, it was impossible not to have a mouthgasm while I ate this thing. Because it was so big, I ate half right away and saved the rest for later. I've also tried their chocolate lava cakes and it's equally delicious. What I like is that the chocolate is not too rich, so you can totally eat the whole thing in one sitting. I wouldn't share, if I were you. On this visit, I tried a brownie. It was incredibly chocolatey and dense - I ate half and saved the rest for later. Lastly, if you see the pistachio/rhubarb bread, go for it. It's amazing!

Service: OK.

Price point: Pretty good. You can get a great loaf of bread for under $4, the chocolatine and brownie were about $3 each. These guys are top notch in terms of using quality ingredients. Check it!

Location: In old town. The closest subway is Champ-de-Mars and it's a 5-minute walk from there. Street parking is available [metered] but finding a spot is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Public transit is the better option.

I precede my standard review format with one word: Impeccable. 

The place: Not huge by any means, but the space is cozy and comfortable and reminds me of an urban chalet. I really liked the overall vibe of L4C and any place that plays Johnny Cash and Leonard Cohen is rocking in my books. 

The goods: Well, first of all, I'm still stuffed this morning, so that should say something, right? 

Starters: I'm not much of a meat eater. I know - I say this often. But I do like to be adventurous from time to time, so I decided to go with the Boudin Blanc, served with Kohlrabi, tarragon, and raspberry. Sweet baby Jesus, was this good OR WHAT? No, it wasn't - it was great. Unlike your standard Boudin, L4C's version is made with fowl and thus, the texture is a little softer and more delicate than the blood variety. It reminded me of Cretons, actually, but with a milder flavor. It was so totally delicious that I wish I could chow down on this again this morning. My date ordered the White Onion Soup [smoked sturgeon, elderberry, sorrel]. This soup is unlike any onion soup that you've ever had because a) there's no bread, b) there's no onions and c) there's no fromage. Rather, it's a creamy kinda soup. I loved this - the sturgeon was a really interesting flavor to combine with the soup and really brought everything together. If you order either of these starters, your belly will thank you. Fantastic.

Mains: I opted for the Yellow Sturgeon, served with naked oats, carrot, Brussel sprouts, veal jus with smoked herring, savory. First off, the dish was beautifully presented (well, they all were). I hadn't tried Sturgeon before which is why I selected this fish over the Arctic Char. Sturgeon is pretty meaty so don't let the fact that it's 'just fish' fool you into thinking this is going to be a light option. It's not. I quite enjoyed this, and the veal jus with smoked herring really complimented this fish. It was delicious. Now, there weren't actually any Brussel sprouts on my plate - only leaves, so I guess maybe they were going with a deconstructed theme? In any case, another amazing dish. My date had the Suckling Pig, served with celeriac puree, cherry, radish, sweet gale jus.  I forgot to take a photo of this one, but the presentation was wonderful. She loved every bite of her dish and she wiped it clean before the server came over to take her plate away. So much so, that he laughingly commented on this. 

Dessert: It shouldn't surprise anyone that I went with the chocolate option, right? Didn't think so. I ordered the Kalingo Dark Chocolate & Peanut dessert, served with a Concorde grape sorbet and pear. Another stunning presentation, and HELLO - once you combined the chocolate mouse with the peanut powder, your mouth found itself filled with the gourmet version of a Reese PB cup. The chocolate was amazing - not at all rich or too sweet.  My date opted for more wine over dessert. Tant pis/ touch sh*t for her!

Service: I can't say enough about the spectacular service that we received here. Honestly, when I walked in and saw that all of the waiters were bearded and sporting plaid shirts, my immediate thought was "GREAT. I've walked into Hipster central. How the hell did this happen?" This myth however, was quickly dispelled as soon as the host greeted me in a friendly fashion and with a huge welcoming smile. Relief. Our main waiter for the night was the fabulously awesome Guillaume. Not only was he the friendliest waiter to ever sport a beard and plaid shirt, he was also extremely attentive and knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu. He guided us through the menu and answered all of our questions with no hesitation, his knowledge of wine made me wonder if he worked at a vineyard in his former life, and more importantly, he made every effort to accommodate my date, who is unfortunately plagued with Celiac disease. L4C is very gluten-free friendly and have no qualms about modifying most of the dishes on the menu. On a more general note, our water glasses were refilled continuously, our table was cleared immediately between dishes and well, service rocks. 

Price point: One glass of wine + appy + main + dessert will run you about $75 plus tax. 

Make a reservation - these guys pack a full house on weekends.

Hands down, the best place to shop for your pet anywhere in the country...believe me, I have looked in pet stores everywhere my travels take me to!  

The owners, Tony & Vince, make the experience so enjoyable.  They truly get to know you and your pet and make recommendations that are always spot on. 

They have the most unique items from clothing, jewelry, toys, beds etc.  Everything we buy for our dog, Lily, comes from Mackie's Parlour.  I love that they gave her a VIP card too...guess that means we buy a lot there!

Trust me, you must check this place out if you are a pet owner...totally worth your time and money!

Long story short, after a short discussion with an employee, who kept coming back and forth to my table while I was waiting for my food, she informed me that her manager said I was asked to leave because I couldn't provide proof or paperwork stating that the dog I had with me was, in fact, an actual service dog. Clearly the manager of this restaurant doesn't know that a service animal and their handler are protected against the Federal Law and that a person with a service dog may voluntarily present any proof but is NOT required to do so and you may not insist on proof or ask a person to leave because they could not, or would not, present any paperwork. In the end, they noticed, as I pointed out, the card on the do/ vest stating that rule and she left. 2 stars because the food was good and the other cashier was friendly, but overall, very irritated that a manager doesn't know the laws and even I myself, who was once a manager elsewhere, knew that.

This is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. I love my burgers and this place lets you design your own. I love how fresh the food is. It's vegan/vegetarian friendly as well. You pick your meat patty then go from there. I like how they offer different options such as bison, elk, crab, and chicken burger. The one thing I wish they had was sweet potato fries. If you are still hungry after they have delicious shakes. I had all of them my favorite is the fluffer nutter!! You can also choose between chips, fries, corn bread, beans and a salad. I like the salad because it's very big and generous. I love to make my own meal!

the rosemary garlic fries have a very strong garlic taste, which I like.

the crust on the pizza is so damn great. if you're eating a pizza & don't eat the crust, there is something wrong with you & i will never be your friend.

The wife turned me on to this place when we were searching for something local to do over the weekend and I was greatly impressed! We ended up spending the entire day at Springs Preserve because it is such a large place and there are quite a few exhibits to see, trails to walk/ride, and plenty of places to practice photography.

Since we're locals, we only paid $20 to get in ($10/ea.) and, at the end of the day, they allowed us to turn that $20 into a $45, two-person annual pass!

I took over 500 pictures that day and only spent time in about 60% of Springs Preserve.

Check out my photos here: http://www.panoramio.com/user/8631485/tags/Springs%20Preserve. That will give you an idea of what you'll see and what you can do.

The Divine Cafe is a great place to take a break, relax, and eat some great food. They also serve wine to go along with your pizza or other food offerings.

We don't have kids, but there were quite a few playing around in the kids playground and we were able to see the butterfly exhibit which was awesome!

This particular Fresh & Easy is a breeze to get in/out of on Saturday afternoons. They have some great ready-made meals that work well for lunch and their meats and fish are good quality.

The staff is always friendly and helpful and have smiles on their faces, ready to help anyone with anything.

Make sure you sign up for their reward's card and you'll get a few dollars off your purchases from time to time - well worth it.

I went in with my boyfriend to have a good time. We ordered cheap drinks. A beer and a wine was about $10. Awesome! Tasted great. We played a game of pool and it was a blast. Kind of weird that the bartender we ordered from walked past me and squeezed the small of my back. NOT Exactly what I want to feel from a creepy man I do not know on a date. 

God forbid we play shuffle board. We got through 1/2 of a game when I was cut with a LARGE SHARD OF GLASS. The bartender that served us earlier walked by and we grabbed him. 

"Can I have something to get this bleeding to go down?" 

"Yeah sure you can have this dirty rag that I've been cleaning with all night" 

"Thank you, I will." I grab it and I press down on my cuts. They continuously bleed and within minutes the rag is surprisingly bloody. It was a deep cut. 

The bartender comes out of the back room and I pull him aside and say "hey man, this cut is deep. We can't finish our game that we paid $6 for. Any chance you could at least refund us for a game or give us a a free round of drinks?" 

*the gods unleashed a demon* 

"NO I CANT GIVE YOU FREE DRINKS IT IS ILLEGAL. I WAS NICE AND GAVE YOU MY RAG. THATS ALL I NEED TO DO. I AM THE HEAD MANAGER I DONT NEED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU I WAS PERFECTLY NICE." 

So I asked him to throw away my bloody rag. 

He refused. 

"NO I WILL NOT TOUCH THAT RAG MAAM I ASKED YOU TO THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT O- BLOOD TYPE" 

"But I'm asking you because I can't find the trash to throw it away" 

" YOU ARE BEING UNRULY I WILL THROW YOU OUT OF THIS BAR *RIPS THE BEER FROM MY HANDS AND PUSHES ME OUT OF THE BAR* GET OUT" 

Mind you, I've had two beers in 4 hours. I am clearly not so intoxicated that A) I can't articulate myself as I write this yelp review..ha and B) clearly I am absurd for jokingly asking for a compensated round of drinks since I just ruined a game because I cut myself enough to be uncomfortable gripping a mere shuffle board puck. And lastly, C) God forbid I expect the manager, self described as the "head manager" to be able to console me after an unfortunate experience. 

I put the rag in the nearest receptacle that happened to be a planter and not a trash can because again, I had no idea where the trash was and mr. O- blood type did not want to touch it or apparently tell me where the trash was. 

He ripped my $5 beer from my hand and kicked me out. 

Will NEVER be returning. And to think that this was named Phoenix's best 50 restaurants...ha! Absurd. I immediately texted my girlfriend about he incident and she replied "I hate ernie's. The last two times I was there I had food poisoning". Enough said I will not be returning.

The Original Pancake House (OPH) is my 2nd favorite place for breakfast on the weekends (Pewter Rose is the first).  And they're one of the few Charlotte brunch options that opens before 10 a.m.  They offer an extensive menu of breakfast selections, including eggs, waffles, and, of course, pancakes.  

Since I'm usually an egg person for breakfast, I'm usually steered past the pancakes and waffles and go right for the omelettes or other egg dishes.  Their omelettes are HUGE.  They seem like they're made from like 18 eggs or something.  None of the omelettes really seem to have a lot inside them (the ingredients aren't overflowing), but my favorite is the sausage one.  Also tasty are their seafood crepes and Eggs Michael (Eggs Benedict with sausage instead of Canadian bacon), as well as their regular Eggs Benedict.  And, last but not least, there's the Kosher meal:  eggs with salami and potato pancakes on the side.  YUM!  I'm not Jewish, but I do love a good Kosher breakfast!  (Miami has an awesome Jewish breakfast place, too, but I draw the line at "tongue.")  Potato pancakes are a delicious treat -- more tasty than hashbrowns, but not as filling as regular pancakes.  

This particular location of the OPH is across the street from the high-end SouthPark Mall, so you think it would be a little more stylish, but it's got that old 80s restaurant feel to it.  A renovation in decorating is definitely needed.  OPH should feel (and look) more like a diner.  I guess that's part of my reasoning for only 4 stars instead of 5.  

If you go on Sundays, be sure to get there before the church crowd!  Or you're looking at about an hour wait.

The new Barnes & Noble just opened near SouthPark Mall...and it's about time.  For being an upscale mall, it was pretty depressing going into the small strip mall B&N that used to be across the street.  Of course, now you have to wander your way through the streets behind the mall to find the new two-story B&N, but it's worth it. 

This B&N has everything you've come to expect:  books, coffee shop, and -- my favorite -- the Bargain Bin.  I can't remember the last time I paid full price for a book.  I have a huge collection of bargain-priced books at home just waiting for me to read.  And if I ever quit working so much, maybe I'll have the time to sit down and enjoy them.  

I love that B&Ns are open from 9-11 EVERY day...even on Sundays!  It's a sad rarity in Charlotte to find anything to do or anyplace open early or late on Sundays, so it's a welcome change to have this bright, new place to go.  

The one thing I'm sad about that I can no longer find at B&Ns nationwide are pop-out maps for cities to which I travel.  I now have to buy them from Amazon.com.  Sigh...

Hi please rape my wallet and then screw me over on customer service and delivery time.  So I ordered a custom white leather sectional from Bassett - I have other pieces from Bassett that were not custom and therefore I received immediately.  The quality is excellent but I AM REELING from my most recent experience here.

When I ordered the sectional I paid by check in full up front and was told the order would be 6-8 weeks for delivery.  It has been ten weeks and I was just told it would be another two.  

Not comfortable with this change in events I said I wanted to cancel my order.  They are apparently saying I cant cancel a custom order.  So what if it takes a year????  Am I still expected to keep waiting??  

So I told April (who works as a sales person or something there)  that they should at least refund my shipping cost or do something to maintain this customer relationship.  She says 'Probably we won't do that, you will have to talk to Carla and we have great relationships with our customers' .  Oh really?  By doing this to them?  And btw Carla hasnt returned ANY of my phonecalls!!!  

She said 'All custom orders take longer than 6-8 weeks'.  So I said 'Why did Kevin  (my salesperson) tell me that it would be 6-8 weeks then?  Is he new here?'  Of course the answer is that I was MISLEAD KNOWINGLY by the sales staff and once they got my check for nearly $5k they completely stopped concerning themselves with my order.  So yes I feel USED AND ABUSED but lesson learned...sigh.....Please be exceptionally careful with any Bassett store and NEVER BUY CUSTOM FURNITURE!!!!!!  I hate you Bassett!!!  (P.S. I will be honest and update this review if it comes sooner by some miracle from heaven or if they refund my shipping cost.)

Recommended by a local, this place is feels very authentically Italian.  Though the situation did not allow us to partake in wines, it seemed like there was a decent selection.

For starters, we had the wild mushroom soup and a burrata cheese caprese-like appetizer.  Both very good, but the wild mushroom soup was fantastic.  

For main courses, we had the papardelle and the parchment steamed whole fish.  The whole fish had a show with the chef coming to the table to debone the fish for us.  It was a fun affair, but being asian and eating whole fish all my life, I could have probably deboned it better.  

All in all, the price was reasonable, the service friendly, and the food memorable.  Definitely a place to try outside the typical Vegas fare.

If you are in the Las Vegas/Rainbow Area, you need to give this place a try.  I recommend their #1 named after the restaurant.  

Excellent food, tons of parking and great service make this place the spot to go to when in town.

I've never actually stayed in the Hotel but have dined and played.  Our most recent visit was awesome, as we came in placed a bet and won!  We left right away as we new it wouldn't happen again.  

BTW, we bet $10 on Black 33 and left after leaving a quick tip. That was the best $300+ made in less than 2 minutes...  

The reason why we decided Black 33, was it was my wife's new age... can you believe it!!!

I considered pushing our luck on BJ but all of their tables were full.  Plus the people looked pretty sketchy...

Having stayed in practically all 4 and 5 star resorts on the strip I just say the Delano upgrade to the former Hotel of Mandalay Bay was done right. The rooms are very comfortable with all white and off white tones. The suites are just the perfect amount of space to relax and unwind. There are three TVs that keep you preoccupied and hooked on watching the next game or race if you're a degenerate gambler hahahaha... Or for those who follow the stock market, the crawlers are always moving. The Keurig is a great addition and I especially enjoy the sunken tub that is separate from the shower. I'd be back again but not on a mega fight weekend as this is between Mayweather and Pacquiao. 

The valet is located in the rear and same with the registration.

I ended up leaving a polo shirt and my swim trunks in the room and went back to pick it up and was told it was not available for pickup! How could you lose my Lacoste Polo and dirty add swim trunks in the span on an hour!? 

Overall a great hotel but bad internal controls especially for lost and found items... Smh

Do you love flying U.S. Airways and paying $2 for water, $15 for a checked bag and $1,000 to take a bathroom break? Well, then you'll love Camden Copper Square apartments! In terms of ridiculous charges, they are the "US Airways" of apartments.

Operated by the Wal-Mart of multi-family housing in America (Camden), the prosaic garden apartments near the Phoenix Children's Museum offer you the privilege of paying a broad array of fees. How about $30/month (plus $10/month for the trash dumpster) to have your trash picked up S-R nights outside your door? I guess they're going for true "NY chic" by allowing you to pay for the privilege of piling trash outside of your door in a wooden box. Don't worry! There's more. $40/month for "included" cable sound "entertaining"? Or expensive water fees that are charged based on square footage instead of how much water you use? I save the best for last, however. Enjoy paying $30/month for so-called "association fees." This means the Camden corporation passes its property tax assessment for getting advertising in the city's downtown partnership "Copper Square" maps and pamphlets on to its residents. Stressed out about having to choose between "valet trash" or being a member of the "association"? Don't worry! You are required to pay both fees!

While the office staff is generally friendly (some members are really exceptional) and maintenance service is adequate, the fees charged by this complex are entirely out of line when added to the complex's higher-than-average base rents. Attempts to reason with the regional staff about the fees are met by: "this is a corporate-level/national policy."

The pool areas and club house are nice, but why pay so much for what you can get in any complex or condo community in Phoenix? The reason I still live here is because I'm leaving the area in May and wanted to spend the summer traveling and not moving boxes in the PHX oven. Those seeking a long-term home in downtown with more freedom of action than myself should pass over this fee-crazy complex for lower-priced condos or historic home rentals with more charm and nicer interior finishes. I'm just waiting for an announcement for a "Camden Copper Square" credit card to come out of my bedroom's fire alarm speaker and wake me up--yes, that would truly make this community rival this town's hometown airline for ridiculousness.

Charged well over 280 dollars for "paint" at the end of my residency. When charge was contested, a refund was provided--to the credit of the management.

Also, Valet Trash continued to tick me off until the end of my residency, especially when a friend showed me the following he had googled from the Valet Trash Web site: 

"Camden's trash-to-cash success
Camden is more than happy for the opportunity
to offer its residents the service in an
ever-expanding number of markets and, over
the past year, has seen the program produce
ancillary income far beyond what the apartment
REIT expected in September 2007. A
Valet Waste customer for the past 10 years,
beginning with its Florida portfolio, by fall of
last year the program was serving 26,500 residents
at 69 Camden properties. The company
saw net income/profit of $40,000 from the
trash pick-up amenity in August 2007, when
Camden execs expected Valet Waste would
begin picking up the trash five nights a week
at an additional 6,089 units in another 20
communities by Q4 2007 and that the program
would contribute $2 million annually
in net profits by 2009.
A year later, in September 2008, Camden
reported a $740,000 profit from the trash
pick-up program for the second quarter,
which averages out to nearly $247,000 a
month, with more than 35,000 units at 95
of the REIT's 182 communities participating
and expectations for annual net profit of
between $4 million and $5 million by 2009,
more than twice that expected a year earlier
for the same target."

If you need a new computer, or service on yours I highly recommend visiting Red Seven.  These guys know what they are doing and they are out to give you the best product at a great price.  Tell them what you want to do with your computer and they will custom build a new machine that will do everything you need it to.  If you don't have a lot of $$ they will sell you a used machine that is light years ahead of what you might pick up at a retailer for 5 times the price.   Small business owners, give them a call and ask them about their perpetual PC deal.

If you need to pick a brain, this is the place to go.  Save yourself from the big Corporations - you will be buying a first rate backed product with mom and pop personal service.

Tired of the standard breakfast fare?  Stop by Pleaissant Croissants and pick up a dozen or so to bring to the office or treat yourself to just one.  They have a large variety of flavors.  If you bring an assortment to the office each is coded with a frosting doodle indicating what's inside.

These will make you a star, if you're late be a little bit later,  no one will notice.

This is going to be a long one . . .

I used Grayline twice during my Vegas Vacation.  First, as transportation to and from the airport. . .tip. . DO NOT BOOK ONLINE AHEAD OF TIME.  Just get your tickets at the airport---I was charged $2 extra because I pre-booked (price online $16 price at airport $14).  The shuttle to the hotel was very hot, sweat stains were visible on every seat--very appealing. . .  The return trip was better, but was cooler and they were prompt for pick up.  

The second time I used Gray Line was for the "Deluxe" tour of the Hoover Dam. . . there is NOTHING deluxe about this tour.  The reason I am giving 2 stars instead of one is that Tony was my driver and he was awesome!  He made the day fun.  Gray Line uses the same shuttle to pick up at every strip hotel (over 50 people, this alone took over an hour).  Then, you are shuffled off of your bus and in to a building about 10 minutes away from the strip.  Here you wait in a line to hear a short presentation.  . . .then you wait inline to check in. . .then you wait in line to board the same bus you came to the building you just exited 30 minutes ago.   You are encouraged to stock up on snacks, water and junk in their gift shop at this spot because their prices are "much better" than the Dam.  Hey, I already bought my ticket, just give me my tour---stop trying to sell me junk.  

I was traveling alone so I sat in the first seat on the bus.  I could see the "check engine" light was lit.  I asked the driver if the bus was safe and he assured me all was well.  After pulling on to the highway, the driver had to pull over, turn the bus off and turn it on again (It appeared to be getting stuck in gear).  3 times we stopped to restart the bus, on the highway, I felt like we were destine to be hit by oncoming traffic.  Each time, our driver called Gray Line and reported the troubles but nothing was done.  About 10 minutes from Boulder City, our bus just stopped working.  Stopped, stranded in the middle of the dessert--in a dangerous part of town.  The driver said that we would have a new bus in 20 minutes.  After and hour of sitting and waiting for our bus, I called Gray Line directly to ask what was going on.  They informed me that they would have a bus there in about 30 minutes but could not guarantee the time.  They were extremely rude and unhelpful on the phone--shuffled me around to 3 different people.  They just kept telling me things happen (you are in the tour guide business, you should have a plan for things like this...especially if you knew the bus was in trouble before we left---i'm no expert but "Check Engine" in usually and important problem). After approximately 90 minutes, sitting in the middle of the hot desert (temp was 103 degrees) another bus arrived. This bus looked to be about 20 years older--there was duck tape on multiple places on the roof, it looked like it was falling apart).  After this fiasco, I was hot, tired, and stressed.  It was difficult to enjoy any aspect of the tour from this point on.

-I was picked up from my hotel at 9am. . .I arrived at the Hoover Dam around 12:30.  3 and 1/2 hours . . .on a bus to go a few miles. . .  interesting

The driver was informative along the way and very funny.  I really enjoyed spending the afternoon with Tony (our guide/driver).  He remained, calm, friendly and helpful even through our break down.  I heard him pleading with Gray Line to help.   

After that, the tour was enjoyable. I can't really speak to the Hoover Dam tour here because tour guides at the Dam took over, not a Gray Line employee.

After the Dam, you are taking to a "deluxe" buffet lunch in Henderson. . .the price tag advertised for this "deluxe" lunch was $7.00 in a low budget hotel.  The lunch consisted of hamburgers, hot dogs, tacos and other fast foodish items. Most items reminded me of TV Dinners.

My advice to Gray Line:  
-Run multiple shuttles for strip pick up.
-Cut out the pointless check in stop. . .just pick us up and head to the Dam. . .I know you want to try to sell us your snacks, water and tacky souvenirs but please, spar us.  
-Update your busses.  Do not let busses go out that are unsafe.  We knew the bus was broken before we boarded. Breaking down was inevitable, unsafe and irresponsible on your part.  We were in a bad part of town, we were lucky nothing happened--a bunch of stranded, unarmed (no weapons allowed at the Dam) tourist is a great target for criminals.
-Take us to a better lunch or don't take us at all.  The $7 buffet was an insult.  
-Offer some type of compensation when errors on your end occur.  I asked for some type of compensation for my troubles and horrible experience and was basically told to eat dirt.  
-Work on your customer service skills.  Everyone I spoke with (excluding the awesome driver) was rude and unhelpful.  

I hope you pay your drivers well, they are the best thing you have going for yo

I only had breakfast here.  I did not stay at the hotel.  This review is based on decor and food.  

I was unimpressed with Silverton.  It's WAAAAAY South of the strip.  Not a lot going on here.  It's probably good for families that want to come to Vegas but don't want to bring their children to the center of the action or older people looking for a quiet casino get away.  

The buffet was just okay.  Typical greasy breakfast items with a limited fruit selection.  Food items were generic.  Looks like mass purchased items just heated up.  Vegas has so many amazing dining options, it hard to settle for mediocre.  

Best part about the hotel is the amazing aquarium in the lobby.  Beautiful, large aquarium with a great selection of fish.

What can I say. ..a Starbucks is a Starbucks!  That is why they are so popular.  Their product is consistent.  My only complaint--and this for EVERY Starbucks in Vegas is the astronomical prices.  Their items cost almost double what their items cost any where else.  Every Starbucks I entered was completely packed, I can't imagine the price hike is necessary . . . just greedy.

Cool experience.  They out you right into a scene of the times.  They also have so e cool mob memorabilia  and good facts about mob activity in Vegas.  It is a little over priced though. Do the yelp deal if you are going to go!

Hello Bistro is a nice concept for a college town.  It like and express Eat N Park with a very limited menu.  They had salads with a great selection of topics!  It was like a salad bar but the staff prepares your salad for you (much more sanitary than the traditional salad bar).  They also had a nice selection of burgers.  The burgers are cooked like Eat N Park burgers (they are cooked well, you cannot choose how you want your burger cooked)

The staff was friendly, the layout was nice.  

I wish they had a few more options on the menu and I wish they served Eat N Park cookies!!!!!

They are called Sr's Barber Shop, now.

Have visited this shop three times.  Usually two to three barbers and the two ladies have taken care of me on my visits.  Both do a good job to your direction.  

Nice little place, usually get a chair right away, quality cut, and prices are very fair.  Can't beat that!

Nice people; Inconsistent haircuts

I like the shop and the people.  It can be a little busy, so you know they are doing something well.  Prices are reasonable and it's a chance to watch some sports or an action flick while you get a trim.

Only knock is that I get a different haircut each time.  Same instructions, but depending on the person and the day, I can come out looking quite a bit different.

The customer service at this place is truly awful.  It's nearly impossible to call the locations directly - you have to dial into a main line, then enter an extension, which doesn't work half the time.  If no one answers, there's no voicemail, you have to call back again and again.  Their website doesn't list hours for each of the locations either and since no one answers the phone, I've had to call multiple locations to try and figure out the hours of different salons...and what's even more ridiculous is that the staff doesn't always know the hours of other salons!

I've been a member here for over a year and recently tried to cancel my membership.  I tried calling and wasn't able to reach anyone there MULTIPLE times.  Finally I reached someone who told me to email Corporate.  I emailed them and it took over a week for them to respond.   They then told me that I'd be charged for the following month because of their 30 day cancellation policy....even though I'd already been trying to cancel for over a week! 

Each location has different levels of quality - there's ZERO consistency.  Some locations are really nice and some are totally beat up.  It's like they just gave up on them.  Their Versa spa machines vary wildly and some of them are just plain unclean.  The owners of this business clearly have the market cornered and don't care about customer service or keeping a high level of quality across all locations.  

Hugely disappointing.

I've been here twice and the lady who did my pedi was super sweet...but I went in to get a full set of acrylic nails from the guy that's there and was really disappointed.  They looked good at first, but not even 4 days later, they started lifting.  Within a week, half my nails had lifted to the point that I had to pop them off.  He was really nice and worked quickly, but just not a quality job.  

Also, the location is very weird and while it's mostly clean, it's not exactly immaculate.  It could definitely use a makeover.

Finally spent a couple nights here!   The service, as I mentioned before, is amazing. From the moment we arrived, it felt like we our personal bellman who even escorted us to our room pointing out important features along that way.  For example, you have to hold your room key in front of the elevator control to go to your floor.  Great security!  The front desk doubles as your concierge and you call them for everything include valet pick up.

The rooms are really nice as you can see by everyone's pictures.  I should tell you the alcohol in the mini bar isn't your little airplane samples, but substantial size for you to party in your room without running out.   I assume if you did, they would gladly bring you another bottle.

2 things that kind of made me not give 5 stars.  First, there's not desk in the room. They have a small makeup table, but not deep enough for a laptop.  Second, you have to ask the front desk when you want ice because it's in a locked housekeeping closest.  While it's a nice touch, and they do refill it as part of the turn down service so it's full when you get back to your room, kind of annoying for people like me who are independent.  Then you feel like you need to tip just for ice.  If you want a quick bite, you have to go the Flamingo or Bally's across the street.  Not a bad thing as the Cromwell is so small I'm not sure where they would put a quick service restaurant. Also, no tub, just a shower.  

And speaking of the shower, but you turn it on, look up.  If you think you're just turning on the handheld shower, you're in for a cold surprise.  

Again, the location of the hotel/casino can't be beat.  The dealers are super friendly and supervisors go out their way to make sure you are satisfied.  Keep up the good work Cromwell!

Visiting Phoenix for the weekend. I needed to find a place to meet up with friends in the middle. So glad I picked The Gladly. 

We started with the Brussels Sprouts. You must get these, the corn grits were amazing with them. 

The Spicy Bloody Mary was fantastic! 

Feedback from the table. 

Burger: big, juicy, cooked as ordered, heavy on the blue cheese, great fries. 

French Toast: berry compost was delicious and so was the whipped cream.  

Fish Tacos: overall good dish, found a few bones in my fish, great flavor. 

I was to go back and try the chopped salad, it looks amazing.

I've loved Phat Burrito for a big, philling (see what I did there?!) lunch for years now. I typically get a chicken burrito with the fruity salsa they put in the fish burrito with chips and queso. That cheese is heaven and really black peppery. Love it. 
They offer quesadillas and beer too. Don't forget the salsa bar in the side area. 
This past weekend my husband and I wanted to grab a bite of breakfast outside with our pup. Phat Burrito it was. They are open for breakfast until 1030, at least on Saturday. They offer smaller versions of their burrito and they are filled with meat, potatoes, eggs, veggies, you name it. There are a few to choose from and we also shared the grits and cheese with chorizo on top. Man, the flavor a were right in. A but runny to eat with a fork but still yummy. 
It's a great, fast and satisfying meal. We didn't get hungry again until about 4 pm.

Considering I've really only experiences this establishment for a few minutes at a time, here is my short review. 
1. Great hours and not too hard to get in or out of. Note - can't get in on Tyvola side but can on the Old Pineville side 
2. Comparable prices to other washes like this. Greenway Express is still my favorite in S. Tryon. $10 plus $1 upgrade yesterday for the "lava" which is supposed to add another level of protection 
3. Thing is, on my husbands black car, there were spots so not sure everything got rinsed? It was a lot cleaner coming out than it was going in though. Needed salt washed off from WV last weekend and it did the trick

Not dry at all, cooked perfectly with great seasonings. The yellow sauce was my favorite. The plantains and green beans were really good too. 

Highly recommend the quinoa stuffed avocado (I added pulled chicken to mine) and whatever the green colored tea is

Lots of really good salad

At first the menu looked a bit overwhelming but I quickly realized they have a lot of good salad ideas on there. You can also make your own creation but I tend to stick to the options they give (which are a ton) 

They also let you try everything without even having to ask. I was concerned the peppers may be to hot but they let me try a few before they put them on the salad so I didn't have to guess if I'd want them or not! 

I've had the southwest and the Kebob Cobb. Both were really good. The chopper suggested I mix the two dressings recommended for the salad I got (again let me try her special mix) and it was delicious so I was really appreciative of them taking the time to offer me a unique suggestion I wouldn't have thought of. 

I tend to go in off times because I have a feeling it's very crowded at peak times. 

The price can be a little high at $10ish dollars for a salad but they are huge and can last for two meals

After all the hoopla and all the recommendations finally decided to give this place a shot. I'm with my best friend and my 3 year old son.  We walk in and get seated right away. place looks really nice and plenty of people vouch for it. We sat down and not a single word has been said by our server. we start looking at the menu and talking it over with my friend and son. A family sits next to us and still waiting for a 4th person. the server walks up to them and gives them the run down walks to get them coffee and waters. walks back and helps the 4th person get into their seat. he explains the menu and says he will be back shortly. He walks to the other table on our other side, helps them and asks of they need anything else. We are ready to order and he keeps walking and helping everyone else around us. The man next to us leans over and says " want me to order for you guys? i can clearly see whats going on" I say no thank you. I wait another 10 minutes and still nothing. my son is asking for pancakes and juice. The man and family next to us receives their meals and are looking at us ashamed considering they arrived around 10 minutes after us and to this point the server has yet to say 1 single word to us. I finally have had enough and wave down the "server" he shockingly walks over and i ask for the manager he doesn't say a word and walks away. Him and another man walk towards me the "server" sarcastically says "did i forget to serve you" i told the manager the story and that i was leaving. he said "OK have a nice day"  everyone looked as us as we got up put our coats on and heard my son saying he wanted pancakes. As a purple heart recipient from the war in Iraq this is not what i think about when i think of America. I don't think i have ever felt this from a business. the embarrassment and walking away like we did something wrong by walking out. No single apology or NOTHING. So i cant recommend a business in which didn't even serve us a glass of water. I can assure that neither I or anyone I know will ever attend this establishment after this incident. NO APOLOGY WAS EVER RECEIVED.

I like this store- I have a member card so I save 10% every time I make a purchase- believe me, it's worth it. (Also a Hawaiian Miles Mall participant. Free shipping on the website with orders of $50 or more.) I don't shop here when it's regular price- hey, these prices are high. I come here a few times a year when there are two big sales. I buy in bulk so I can give the items as gifts- I shop year-round so I always have gifts on hand, for female friends, anyway. That's one of my shopping secrets. In addition, there are other promotions as well, such as "Buy 2 - get 1 free." Since I belong to the e-mail club, I get the updates and that's how I am in the know. I really love the Body Butter products ( mango, coconut, shea butter, vitamin E, cocoa butter, raspberry, just to name a few- so often imitated, but not perfected), the gifts (no-brainer gift idea), and the foot kits (great as gifts, but I use it too). 


This one's at the Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood casino/hotel. I haven't found much during sale time at this one in recent years. I am guessing because there is more exposure to tourists (so I can blame them- ha-ha, just kidding). Still worth a try checking out if you are in the area.

This was quite literally the crappiest meal I've ever had in my life.  Yes, I know what "literally" means--bear with me, I'll explain.

Problem 1: The Service
We were asked numerous times by different people if we wanted a soft drink (at $2.50 for a small cup of cola?  No thanks), but it took quite a while to get our order taken (maybe they were mad we didn't order a pop?).  After that, the food took a long time to arrive as well.  We ordered some naan, hoping it would come as an appetizer--or at least with the meal--but we never got it.  As we were finishing our meal about an hour later, we flagged someone down and asked him to cancel the order.  He grumbled and wandered off.  We would have brought this to their attention earlier, but at no point during the meal did anyone come to check on us or ask us how the food was.  The empty table next to us had its tablecloth swapped out twice during this period for reasons I can't even guess, but no attention was paid to the customers 3 feet away.  Getting a water refill was a lot like hailing a cab.

Problem 2: The Value
Everything was priced higher than it would be at comparable nearby Indian restaurants, and there was less meat in each dish than you'd get from those same competitors.  The sauces and spices were good, but not even close to enough to justify the gap.  It wasn't that much better than buffet food, and given the long wait and high prices, that was a major disappointment.

Problem 3: The Food (and the Crap)
OK, I promised to explain what I meant by "literally the crappiest meal" and here it goes.  One of the dishes we ordered included shrimp.  The shrimp were large, but had a mysterious and unpleasant earthy taste not attributable to any combination of elements from the pantheon of Indian spices.  Upon closer inspection, the shrimp HAD NOT BEEN DEVEINED.  For those of you who don't know what this means, shrimp have something that looks like a vein running down their backs, but it's actually their intestinal track.  It carries solid excrement out of their bodies.  Step 1 in any dish is to "devein" the shrimp--to remove the tubule of poop so diners don't chow down on a cylinder of seafaring micro-turds.  The kitchen somehow skipped this step, which is SO fundamental, not a single contestant on Food Network's "Worst Cooks in America" failed to complete it adequately when told to prepare shrimp.

At this point you'd think I should have a good conclusion, but amidst a panoply of restaurant no-nos, they LITERALLY fed me shrimp poop.  I'm done.  To paraphrase Billy Madison, I award them one star, and may Vishnu have mercy on their souls.

We would have brought this to their attention earlier, but at no point during the meal did anyone come to check on us or ask us how the food was.  The empty table next to us had its tablecloth swapped out twice during this period for reasons I can't even guess, but no attention was paid to the customers 3 feet away.  Getting a water refill was a lot like hailing a cab.

Problem 2: The Value
Everything was priced higher than it would be at comparable nearby Indian restaurants, and there was less meat in each dish than you'd get from those same competitors.  The sauces and spices were good, but not even close to enough to justify the gap.  It wasn't that much better than buffet food, and given the long wait and high prices, that was a major disappointment.

Problem 3: The Food (and the Crap)
OK, I promised to explain what I meant by "literally the crappiest meal" and here it goes.  One of the dishes we ordered included shrimp.  The shrimp were large, but had a mysterious and unpleasant earthy taste not attributable to any combination of elements from the pantheon of Indian spices.  Upon closer inspection, the shrimp HAD NOT BEEN DEVEINED.  For those of you who don't know what this means, shrimp have something that looks like a vein running down their backs, but it's actually their intestinal track.  It carries solid excrement out of their bodies.  Step 1 in any dish is to "devein" the shrimp--to remove the tubule of poop so diners don't chow down on a cylinder of seafaring micro-turds.  The kitchen somehow skipped this step, which is SO fundamental, not a single contestant on Food Network's "Worst Cooks in America" failed to complete it adequately when told to prepare shrimp.

At this point you'd think I should have a good conclusion, but amidst a panoply of restaurant no-nos, they LITERALLY fed me shrimp poop.  I'm done.  To paraphrase Billy Madison, I award them one star, and may Vishnu have mercy on their souls.

The High Roller observation wheel is an absolute must while visiting Las Vegas. The price of admission can be a little steep but it's totally worth it for the 30 minute ride. At the time of my visit, I was able to find a groupon for $19; which  was much better than paying the full daytime admission price of $27. Again, it was totally worth it! The views from the wheel are pretty awesome and the pods themselves were too! Each pod can hold up to about 40 people although the average is usually 15. Inside of the pod, there are TVs and music playing which adds to that Vegas party mood. Last but not least, yes, you can have drinks inside on the wheel and if you pay for the VIP ride, there will actual be a bar and a bartender inside of the pod to serve you!

Oh my gosh disappointed.  I gave an extra star for service.  They aren't really lacking there.  I would frequent a BJ's in the Bay Area, excellent!   I can't eat the food here.  There is nothing good about it.  Avocado egg rolls, very bland and could use a better sauce maybe?  He ordered a steak salad took a bite then did not eat it.  The only thing half edible was the margarita pizza, which was super small even. It is not even fun to hang out in there. There is just no flavor in the food.  I usually order the pazookie which is my favorite.  My food was so disappointing I decided to skip the dessert to go somewhere else. When you joke around about going to the closest fast food joint after dinner... It can't be good?  Try the restaurant most adjacent that place even is better than this.

This was my first time at the AZ State Fair and I had a blast!
I recommend coming on a Thursday or Sunday (?) cause I believe those are the two days that you can get an unlimited ride wristband for 30 dollars. (Its definitely worth it!) 
There were a ton of great shows, from the Bird show (I got to hold a parrot!) to the Hypnosis show (my fiance was selected) lol everything was entertaining. There were a TON of food options at typical fair prices 5-15 dollars on average. We tried the deep fried cheeseburger and deep friend mac and cheese (yum!). As for adult beverages there were a lot of options for craft beer, each stand was different which was great. They also offered things like Sangria and Margaritas. 
I feel like we bounced around the park all day, we even shot some live zombie actors with paintball guns. and saw Sheryl Crow in concert...she was amazing! 
I took the bus to this location to avoid having to pay for parking so Im not sure how much that cost/inconvenience it was. 
I will definitely be back next year!

This is a cute little area! 
I came here recently for a Lyft event where we had catered pot pies (delicious!) with great salads. 
I had a hard time finding it at first, but the ambiance is wonderful. 
Our event was actually out in the barn, which was a little too dark on the inside for my taste.. .but had a decent amount of room for a 50 person group. 
The patio area outside the barn is beautiful, covered with lots of shade and the trees are all wrapped in lights with amazing lanterns. The patio also had a fountain with koi fish, which was a nice touch. 
They have a lot of plants fenced off around the property and really does look like "a garden". 
Consider hosting an event here! 
I bet this place would be very romantic at night!

When I think of Marathon, I think "simple, done right." Marathon sees no need to be fancy, but they do the basics really well. 

I NEVER expected that Marathon (this location and the one off Decarie near the old Blue Bonnets) would be staples on my restaurant list. When I want no-nonsense Greek style food that I know will be prepared well, I don't have to think very long (and I'm not the most decisive person when it comes to choosing a restaurant.)

2 chicken sticks with half-and-half rice and fries and a side of greek salad with Marathon dressing. Sounds really plain but tastes delicious. And my plate is cleaned - spotless - every time. 

It's just good food. Consistently. Go now. You'll be glad you did.

Had lunch from here today (take out), and was pleased with the food. Taste was good, and prepared quickly, but I was turned off by the 3 spoons of MSG that were tossed into the wok while my dish was cooked. Hmmm... 

(I asked if it was MSG, by the way, and was told "yes, a little bit." 3 spoons is not "a little bit.)

Service was friendly, though, and the price was excellent. All in all, 2.5-3 stars, but I'm feeling generous... so 3. Maybe the MSG is affecting me.

I can't give 5 stars for a meat slicer, bread, and raw veggies, but consider this the strongest 4 star review possible. This is just good, consistent, fresh-tasting food. And I like the $5 footlong promotions, but I just can't bring myself to try the mortadella. The cross-section just looks too creepy for my tastes. 

I should say, though, that I think that the Dagwoods sauce (original) is worth 5 stars. Yum, yum. yum. 

Simple, cheap, can't go wrong. (though I did order the chicken sub once and found that to be very skimpy.)

Pros: It's huge, and they have lots of great machines. Good atmosphere too. If you can't find a machine that works for you here, then I wonder if you can be satisfied at all. 

But, they have let a lot of the small details get away from them.  

At peak hours, good luck getting a locker. And, if you do find a locker, make sure that the place to actually put the lock on it is intact. There are many lockers that, uh, don't lock. 

Also, despite being a 24h gym, they seem to shut down services for long periods of time just because. The pool and jacuzzi are closed as of 10pm, even though these aren't drained every night. What's the reason?

Speaking of the jacuzzi, the jets are weak. It's basically just a hot pool with a few bubbles. Thankfully, there's a big TV right there. 

And, the jacuzzi was just shut for 1 whole week - no explanation, no compensation, no notice at the front desk. 

Very frustrating. And for a whopping $649+tax/year, I expect more. If this were a $250-$300/year gym, it'd be well worth it, despite the shortcomings.

NOTE: Yelp has two listings for this business but even after submitting edits, will not remove or merge them. The other page is under Jin Jin You Wei. Not sure what the deal is, or if that's just a translation. Former space occupied by Island Malaysian #2, in the same building as Ichiza.

Now that that's out of the way...
Went in to grab takeout, was the only customer for dinner at 7PM on a weekday. Small order took literally half an hour to come out and the food was mediocre.

Ordered the steamed dumplings and lamb pancake. Dumplings were mushy, overcooked, and bland. Taste and appearance were identical to what you'd get frozen in a bag at the grocery store and boiling yourself. Pancake contained a small portion of flavorful lamb- too bad it was overshadowed by all the grease. Opened the takeout box to a puddle of oil. picked up the pancake and had it all over my hands, bit in and got a mouthful of it too. Gross!

Service was dismal at best. As the only customer, the wait time was unacceptable and no excuse or apology was given. I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business. Server barely spoke to me, not even when dropping off or picking up my bill.

Ever since I became a vegetarian the thing I've missed the most was sweet and sour chicken balls. When I discovered that this restaurant had a sweet and sour battered tofu I was eager to give it a try. The General Tao tofu, and the a l'orange version, are absolutely fantastic; they satisfy the craving completely and are incredibly morish.

Back down to Earth for a moment, I've been there five times now and the service and food constancy are extremely INconsistent. The sides seem to change depending on who cooks the food, which feels lazy rather than necessary. Wait times are usually very quick, but I've waited over an hour before, with no apology, explanation, reassurance, or attention (with a fairly empty house.)

Overall I still go back once a week, but there is definitely room for improvement.

Nothing else like it in Charlotte.  The best juices and living food within 100 miles.

I was quite dismayed when I pulled up today and Luna's was no longer there.  Then I turned around and saw they just moved across the parking lot.  A much better location with more outdoor seating.  Still the same love being put in to all the juices and drinks.

So many amazing options to choose from, but this time I just went with the chillied chai.  I should have gone for a berry smoothie, after I tried somebody else's, but no complaints on my end.  My chai was smooth and almond milk creamy.  Just the little kick I needed to continue my day.

Not to much to tell ya on this one as I didn't get any food, but will be back soon!

Expensive bar food and expensive beer, but some beers are worth the price.  Highly suggest going on $3 pint nights.

I went on a Friday night and 9 kegs had been tapped out and weren't replaced.  One of which was the special of the day.  If you are out of your special, make something else cheaper.  I had already eaten dinner, so I didn't need any of their overpriced food.  After I drank my one beer we left.  Outside of pint nights, I just don't think this place is for me.

A charming establishment with an old country feel. We were warmly greeted at the door to submit our name on the waiting list. While waiting to be seated at our table, we decided to browse around the county store which had some neat merchandise you don't see often nowadays. Looking at all their candy, sweets and soda pops from the earlier years reminded me of my childhood. It was a nice trip down memory lane.

Service was great, food arrived promptly and our dishes were to taste. Defiantly a great breakfast or brunch spot for all ages.

The only Buffet worthy of 5 stars is the "Seafood Buffet" at Deer Valley in  Park City.  Bacchanal makes a solid effort but falls just a bit short when it comes to the high end shellfish.

I'm thinking of a new reality tv show..... CRAB LEG WARS! VEGAS!!!! It's a literal frenzy ... All for an average snow crab leg that yields a thin flavorless reward .... Oyster Shooter are in tomato juice... Tip grab some extra cocktail sauce and reconstitute your own version (ala Brophy's).
Without droning on about this and that I'd say just go and experience it once it may be Heaven or it may be Hell.... You decide!?!?!?

Secret super tip for normal people... Make it your first and only meal of the day at 2:30 pm.... Line will be shorter and price skyrockets at 3:00 pm.  They also won't rush you when you get inside.... We stayed for 3 hours!!!!!

Dr. Meharry is the absolute best. It's difficult to find precision, accuracy -and- someone who puts you at ease immediately with a great laugh and rapport. Dr. Meharry has nailed all-of-the-above, and she makes a the normally mundane and painfully routine process of eye exams enjoyable. 

I'm always impressed by Dr. Meharry's ability to offer solutions personalized to each of her patients. I have a stronger astigmatism, making it harder to fit me for contacts, but she always has a great solution that's comfortable, smart and affordable. She is extremely patient and always makes time for my questions about eye wear and care, (and there are many).

Dr. Meharry is an all-around pro and an expert in her field. You won't be disappointed!!

I gotta say, my taste in music consists of britney spears, vanessa paradis, lady gaga, yeah yeah yeahs, and some designer drugs. But now I have to update that list to include CELINE DION!

I never knew how good Celine sang, until I heard her in person! My sister almost cried cause she sang so well! 

The show did start about 10-15min late so don't be in such a rush when coming. She talks in between songs and her voice just blows you away! I can see why her show is sold out all the time!

One thing that did bother me was that all of the songs she sang weren't hers. Like she sang a billy joel song and the theme of goldfinger. If i wanted to hear that, i would just go to a billy joel concert or watch goldfinger. Maybe I'm just bitter cause I wanted Celine to sing all of her own songs like taking chances,

I realized that after I watched her show, then I watched 'The Voice' on nbc and I realized everyone sucked on 'The Voice'. Why? Because Celine is 1000 times better. 

Also, I was so amazed by her voice that I even watched her documentary on youtube, wikied her, and watched her interviews with oprah! God I am such a crazed fan now!

The Colosseum was built very well. The tiered levels are great so anywhere you sit, you get a great view- whether its nose bleed seats or front now! I must say the red curtains with rosey patterns are a bit tacky, but I didn't come here for decor, I came here for Celine- tacky decor or not.

I've been to vegas a couple of times with my family and I would say Vdara is the nicest hotel I've been at. Although, the whole complex looks like LAX or any major airport.

People complain about how there's no casino and self parking, but I don't understand why people are whining about that when the hotel can't really change it and its not like you can say Vdara gave you bad service for something they don't provide a service for. So you should just try to figure out what you want in a hotel and what Vdara can offer, so you can choose the right hotel for you.

We didn't expect Vdara not to have a casino, but we later pleasantly found out that we loved the fact that there was no casino. There is no terrible smell of smoke! BUT, if you do want to go to the casino, the bellagio is connected to Vdara and its only a 10-15 min and Aria's casino is a 5 min walk (there isn't a strong smell of smoke here either, maybe cause its new!)

My room came with a king size bed and a queen pull out couch with 2 tv's. Also a small kitchenette was included! And I had great views of bellagio and its water fountain show. The room came with electronic shades that block out the sun so you can sleep peacefully until the morning without being blinded by the bright morning sun! 

I do have to say that the bathroom door is quite thin, so you can hear a lot of noise that you don't want to really hear. The aveda toiletries and bathroom interiors were nice! Free wifi too!

NOTE: the complimentary valet is a bit annoying, since everytime you want to get your car, you have to tip them. The market cafe has GREAT sandwiches! and good coffee! If you want to shop designer brands but don't want to walk all the way to caesar's, go to crystals! closer and newer!

Fun place next to a strip joint!

There's really nothing like coming in for some Mexican cuisine which leads right into strippers. This location is conveniently placed and the food doesn't disappoint. 

My boss happens to be friends with the owner so we get spoiled here and by spoiled I mean tequila! Thank you Mr. Feinstein for taking good care of us! The decor is a lot of fun and it's a very sexy looking Mexican joint. The food is great as well and after several tequila shots everyone is having a party. I love work nights like this because we all continue our bonding :)

So in between many shots sent our way we also had all sorts of great cocktails from traditional margaritas to the specialty house drinks. They all pack a punch and were great. 

The food was so good! The cheesy thing that had onions, mushrooms, peppers and other goodies that you dipped your chips in as well as flour tortillas was so great. We ordered a ton of good stuff from some street tacos, steak bowl & even the Feinstein special which was my favorite dish. It had chicken, crispy onions, a fried egg all on a side of potato chips. (My memory is blurry from the tequila) but I remember enjoying every bite. 

We had a lot of fun here and will definitely be back. Thank you to our server for putting up with our shenanigans and see you soon :)

Fun place next to a strip joint!

There's really nothing like coming in for some Mexican cuisine which leads right into strippers. This location is conveniently placed and the food doesn't disappoint. 

My boss happens to be friends with the owner so we get spoiled here and by spoiled I mean tequila! Thank you Mr. Feinstein for taking good care of us!

Excellent selection of Scotch, Whiskey and Bourbon!  Good pours for the price.  Knowledgable staff - they know what they got and got what they know!  Helped us learn even more about whiskeys, bourbons, and scotch.

Service is always friendly and attentive.

We ordered the Nachos.. once ... and will never order again :-/  But the pimento cheese and chips Rocked! Yum!

Highly recommend Whiskey Warehouse!

I came to The Keg a Sunday evening to have some appetizers with drinks. I ordered the mini-burgers and a Lemonade Strawberry Basil drink. Both items were amazing, the drink was cool refreshing with just the right amount of alcohol. The mini-burgers (3) were juicy and oh so good. With side of fried onions rings. It was one of the best appetizers I ever had. It was more than enough and if you have a small appetite it could be even ordered as a main dish.  The staff is friendly and welcoming, they kept re-filling our water glass and came by to ask how things are or if we wanted more drinks. It was a pleasant experience, I will be coming back more often.

Great pizza at a good price. 

This was one of our most reasonably priced meals on the Strip. 

Located at the front of the Monte Carlo, it's hard to miss.  It's self service here; you place your order, pay and they cook. They have wine and beer available. Their website and menus go into detail about the type of pizza (neapolitan) they make.  It tends to be sauced and have a softer center.  We enjoyed the pizza here.  And the salad as well.  As mentioned, the prices are good for the strip strip.  Most likely because of the self service setup.  

We really enjoyed it here and will be back next time.

This place is good, but not great.  I started off with the Frito misto.
Chicken drummette, pork belly, homemade biscuit, summer vegetables, heirloom sauce.  The chicken was good, but the pork belly was cold.  The biscuit had very little flavor.  

For the main course I had the Halibut.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the portion was huge.  To be honest it was twice the size it needed to be.  The fish was very good, but it was accompanied by a bunch of different beans...some warm some cold...it was too much beans and not a great flavor to the beans.   I ate all the fish and left about two thirds of the beans.   

The service was very good and I liked the look and feel of the place.  I liked the open kitchen.  We were seated where we could watch them cook.

This place is almost there... it would be good if they could just kick it up a bit...scale back the portion a bit and work on the accompaniments.

Duplicated business entries in Yelp make me notify continuously the moderators that they need to fix them. Terrasse Nelligan also exists as Verses Sky, but the real name is the the first one as per my recent research and I hope those two will merge into one entry soon. 

Four stars for the awesome view of this roof top bar located in Nelligan hotel and its clear sangria with litches. All the drinks were good, only the Old Fashioned was surprising with its muddled chunks of orange instead of finely peeled orange strip, but the drink was not on the menu and they fixed it for our table. As the terrace is certainly associated with the hotel bar Verses I'm sure they can get some bar tender advices on this fine drink (they know how to make strong and well balanced cocktails in Verses bar).

We had cheerful and happy service during our last visit, and overall great time. Wonderful spot to stop for a drink and snack in the Old Port of Montreal!

I may update this after tomorrow when I go back there to have them repair the damage they did to my dashboard....but they will certainly need to earn it!

Here's the story...

Yesterday I called to have them repair the navigation system in my Lexus is350.  Don, the owner was courteous and was able to get me in the same day I called.  

This place is 30 minutes away from me (and I'm visiting from out of state) so I drove right over and made special arrangements to get a ride since they needed to keep my car for several hours.  

When I picked up my car, they charged me $525 for labor...ok....but then $26.25 for MISC....I have no idea what that was for, plus tax too!  I didn't say anything about the extra charge but when I got in my car I was rather annoyed by them not understanding that you return a car the way you found it.  Had to reset the clock, change my radio station from BLARING RAP back to country, turn off the a/c seat they had on high (I don't use it), and hunt for my phone charger they took out.  Any one or two of those things is no big deal but I believe in a service industry you leave other people's property at least how you found it!

But here is the REAL issue....they damaged my dashboard with a huge gash and never said a word!  I'll post a picture.

I called them and then turned right around and returned to the store.  Don was very pleasant and said this happens all the time....SO BE AWARE.  He made arrangements for me to come back on Friday to have it repaired. But he made no other concessions. Now I'm having to take another day out of my five day trip here in Phoenix and pay the gas to drive 30 minutes out of my way and back again in order for them to fix the damage they did to my car!!!!

FAIL!!! :(((((((

****UPDATE!!!! I was unable to go back to  Scottsdale for the repair, as it did not fit into my tight schedule.  Another Yelper messaged me to tell me to "dispute" the charge on my credit card so I did.  Don contacted me and, as consistent as he had been, he was pleasant and respectful and eager to resolve the issue even though me and my car were now in the Bay Area.  And to his credit, he did everything right...he never got angry, he arranged with Marin Lexus to remove the navigation system again, he arranged for a reputable repairman to travel from Sacramento to Marin to do the repair and he followed-up with me.  

I understand that things can go wrong in every business.  I also very much appreciate when a business owner handles those problems fairly and kindly.  Five star update!

WIN :)))))

This buffet goes head to head with the Wynn's buffet for the best in Vegas. I pick the Bellagio over the Wynn every single time and I'll tell you why-- THE WAIT IS SHORTER.

Honestly, when it gets to the fancy $40 per person buffets, the food is pretty much the same. You get all the gourmet meats, all the gourmet desserts, and excellent service. To get anything else would be business suicide especially when you're catering to supposedly rich clientale.

The difference is the wait. The Bellagio used to be excruciating before the Wynn opened but it's manageable unless you come 7pm on the dot. Then I will laugh at you. That's like coming to the DMV after everyone's off work.

There is something for everyone at this buffet and it's good breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

One cute trick my brother figured out is if you come in towards the end of lunch and pay the lunch price, they will switch to dinner with the dinner foods. Thus, you can get dinner for the price of lunch. I'm not sure if they close down the buffet during this period, it's been a few months since I last visited.

However, the interior of the Wynn's buffet is nicer and the prices are better. It also has superior brunch. For dinner, it doesn't matter either way because both buffets are the same.

Broth is excellent and that's where the compliments stop. Went in last night around midnight and ordered the Tonkatsu Black when I noticed a strange stringy substance in my mouth. Pulled it out and found a hair .. but not one of those long hairs from someone's head, rather, a short curly hair much resembling a pube. Brought this to the server's attention and she apologized profusely and got me a new bowl but by then my mom had finished eating and I was grossed out it threw off the meal and I couldn't finish.

This place has a C health rating for a reason. Enjoy your ramen with pubes.

No discount on the tab either, server never refilled our drinks, and location is in a shady area. Pass, for pubes.

This place is definitely just all right. The prices are really high because it carried then Carlos bakery name. If there's no line do it, but waiting 30 plus won't be worth it.

I got 2 canolli a chocolate an regular. Te regular was hallow in te center, only the outsides had cream.

The chocolate canolli was actually good but the girl had to make it and none were I. The widow so possibly why it was filled all the way.

I also got the lobster tail which is actually really good. Pasty was light and flakey and the custard was really good. This is what you should definitely get.

Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.

Personal Experience: This was the second Peppi's I ever visited, back in the old days.

I absolutely loved it! It took about 10 mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling me about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun and interesting and interested in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind of service which is hard to come by these days.

What's more, the sandwich was spectacular. It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best service I've had anywhere, actually.

I would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love it. Best service. Miles better than Primanti's.

And more info:

This place has some of the best subs in Western PA, especially the delicious and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! Yum!

Well, well, well. Long before I was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where I was supposed to eat in any given town I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it "plus an egg". The "plus an egg" thing intrigued me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.

Plus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... "plus an egg". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me a free Roethlisburger in return. The Downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good service or good sub sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good too, but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there.

Hell hath no Fiori's like a woman scorned, and let me just say that other cities have no women like Pittsburgh women. Yes, Ricki, yes, Gina, yes, Alley and yes, Julie, I am talking to you. Spectacular.

Edit: My 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th time at Fiori's - spectacular. I love the taste of the dough and the cheese and sauce, it's just so different to what they serve in Buffalo and elsewhere. It's wonderful, especially when it's fresh and the dough is still floury and doughy.

So anyway, my second time at Fiori's - not as good. The pizza was okay but it was definitely nothing special on my second visit. Maybe it's the best in the Pitt area, but it doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo or Chicago Pizza, so I have to reduce it by a star. That's really sad too because for some reason I had Fiori's as one of my top 10 Pizza in the country... I must have been really hungry that night or something!

My old review is below:

wow, this Pizza is really, really good! I love it! It's the best in Pitt! And get the side of cheese, it's really worth it! It's cold and lovely and goes with it really well! Definitely a big time 5. 5/5

It is a little hard to find this place because it's hidden away, just across a bridge and on an incline up to the West End, if you don't know Pittsburgh well you could get lost, but then again that could be said about any location in Pittsburgh really, couldn't it. Definitely not the easiest city to drive around, but one of the most fun (except in snow or ice, which is common).

The people here are friendly (yes, I said friendly, Pittsburgh sometimes gets a bad rap), and as I said, the side of white cheese is an absolute must - mmmm. Locals in Pittsburgh told me this was the best Pittsburghese Pizza out there, and as far as I can tell they were right. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I will definitely be coming back here when I return to Pitt.

You know what, these might actually be the best Gyros I have ever had. Mr Myers and Mr Danza should be proud of themselves.

I've never been to Greece, and if I had to think of a better Gyro, the only one that comes close, is Central Gyros in Chicago. I can't choose which one I like better, so I'm going to have to say they're jointly the best Gyro I have ever had, and therefore this really is the food gem of Pittsburgh. Of course you have to try Fiore's Pizza and Peppi's Roethlisburger too, but if you only have 1 meal, 1 time, in Pitt, and you like Gyros... here, my friends, is your Mecca. Brought to you by Mr Tyson and Mr Romo.

There are actually two locations of this, and because it had a shorter line, i think I like the Southside version better. But there is one downtown that caters to the lunch crowd, and they are excellent too. Another thing that is fantastic about Mike & Tony's is the price! Their Gyro (piled with juicy delicious meat, with loads of fluffy Gyro style pizza, sharp onions, juicy tomatoes, and creamy yogurt sauce), is cheaper than most burgers! Extremely impressive! Just like the founders, Mr Jackson and Mr Hopkins.

Gyros should be made a certain way. There's an exception, in Buffalo, where "Gyros" are something else entirely in some Greek diners, and are very good, if not as good as traditional Gyros. But what I cannot stand is those fake, frozen, pre-packaged Gyro strips. They are already cut out in Gyro strip shape, and they just grill those and bam, Gyros. No thank you! Gyros are supposed to be shaved off a large spindle, delicious and juicy and fresh... that's the only way to go. Add some yogurt sauce, onions and tomatoes on a Gyro Pita - the end. The best in the world are Mike & Tony's in Pittsburgh, and Central Gyros in Chicago. Nom nom nom. This place does Gyros RIGHT! So thank you Mr Jordan and Mr Soprano.

Parking is tricky and tight at both locations, so be careful. They're always a little tow-happy in Pittsburgh, though not as bad as NYC. Try around the corner from the Southside location, that's your best bet. I asked owners Mr Buble and Mr Bennett and they told me the same thing.

Mike and Tony's - you are absolutely outstanding!!!

My original review (what was I thinking)

One of the best Gyros in America, hands down. Very cheap too. Eat it while it's hot, that's the way it's supposed to be. Then let's make out, so I can taste some of that Gyro too. Well, no, I mean, I'd love to make out anyway, but tasting the Gyro is a bonus. OK OK, I admit it, I just want the Gyro taste! You caught me Blue-and-white handed! (the greek flag. Although there is nothing greek about this place. It just happens to make better Gyros than most Greeks).

So thanks again to Mr J. Fox and Mr Hawk for opening this place!

A friend and I visited Tao's restaurant and club in Vegas during memorial weekend 2015 and we were definitely impressed. 
The restaurant itself is beautiful and spacious. The entrance to the restaurant itself was very unique! Walking into the restaurant there were bath tubs full of naked women tastefully cover in flowers. No pictures were allowed but I tried unsuccessfully anyway. We sat in the bar area until out table was ready and had a drink. The bartenders were helpful and courteous but the bar was very full. 
Once we were seated for dinner we decided to share a meal of their lobster fried rice as well as the glazed salmon. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. However, we both thought the lobster fried rice was very salty and way too greasy. Their was literally a pool of grease in the bowl of rice which we were surprised they did not drain a little before serving it to us.
After having dinner in their restaurant we were informed that entrance into their club was complimentary for all diners. This was a big plus because it allowed us to avoid the $30.00 per person cover charge.
The club was very much like the restaurant - beautiful and full of both naked and costumed woman but this time they were all dancing instead of lounging like the ladies in the bathtubs at their restaurants entrance. Like at the restaurant bar the club bar served very good drinks. Snoop dogg was the entertainment for the night I was there. When the club let out the staff surprisingly handed out flip flops to all the women. But on the downside the flip flops were all the same size but this didn't stop any of the women from using the slippers LOL. My friend said they were a relief from her high heels. I simply took mine home as a souvenir. The take home slippers were definitely a unique touch.
The only negative that I could recall beside the one size fits all slippers was the greasy rice but the rest of my experience was wonderful. I'd definitely return when I'm in Vegas again.

Update 2015-12-10: Looks like a bunch of other people were annoyed with them too. This place has been sold to the people who own the wildly-overpriced Hearthstone restaurant next door. It will have a new name and a new menu coming in 2016. http://vegas.eater.com/2015/12/8/9872852/las-vegas-restaurants-mercadito-out-at-red-rock-resort-libre-in

Update 2015-10-01: They've been making menu changes and portioning changes. Tacos now come one at a time, minimum 2. Makes it way easier to mix-and-match so that's a welcome change. However they added pineapple to a previously-delicious guacamole that included bacon, and it completely ruined it. They also no longer have the BLTA taco, which was BY FAR the best taco I've ever had. On the up-side, they added the short rib taco to the menu permanently.

The nachos from the "small plates" menu, while extremely delicious, are much larger than I expected for my same $10. In fact, they are large enough that I could have easily made an entree meal out of the nachos alone (and I would have been happy to, because they are delicious). The tacos come four to a plate and are very well executed, and seem to be priced just slightly high but portioned very well.

Salsas are also not free. Even then hole-in-the-wall places can afford this, I know it isn't going to break the bank. Chips and salsa is a Mexican food expectation. Period.

So we're all over the map already.

The decor seems to try to be upscale, trendy, high class, with fancy plate settings (at the expense of usability, see the guacamole plate); at the same time there are TVs on the walls showing football games both in the bar and outside of it in the main seating area and my tortilla chips came in one of those bent-metal-wire things you typically get french fries or pretzels or mozzarella sticks in wrapped up in butcher paper at some crappy sports bar.

Expanding on the guacamole coming out on such a small and annoying plate, the same could be said for the entree plates. The flautas we ordered -- which are actually not flautas, they're toquitos, but they're delicious so who cares? -- are too large to fit on the plates provided except diagonally, and that makes it a pain in the ass to try to eat politely. The wife and I ended up eating them with our hands. But then...Is that what the owner intends? Is this an eat-with-your-hands kind of place? Because if so I think your waiters are overdressed, and we should talk about the ritzy place settings...

Adding even more confusion to what this place is really about.

Over the course of 20 minutes the music went from a 70s rock ballad to some bass-dropping dubstep to a Coldplay song that almost put me to sleep to the Gorillaz. None of this particularly related to the delicious food in strange portion sizes, or the upscale dive bar decor, or the Mexican cuisine.

I'm completely perplexed by this place. Primarily, the star-loss is for price/portion/plating issues. I felt nickle-and-dimed by the guac and chips/salsa, and the way most of the food was presented was needlessly irritating.

This is a good neighborhood spot, and it's location is perfect for those dizzy-days-takeout-required kind of suppers. I ordered the beef tacos, and they were respectable and good! This is a clean, no-frills store front, and the service is efficient, which is perfect for that witching hour right after a frenzied work day when I am craving crispy, savory, tacos like a baby to a pacifier. There isn't anything to distinguish this place from competitors, and that's probably my only complaint. It's just not distinct to stand out.

Why is everyone else writing their reviews on the listing on Hanna?? Wrong address peeps!
So I had been wanting to eat here for a while, but everytime I come to Westgate it was to meet friends at one of the big restaurants there.
So I came here today on my own for lunch. It was pretty easy to figure out how to order (you pick a bag by number that corresponds to the category number on the menu then you choose your toppings)
I got the Ruben with provolone and thousand island and I substituted the sauerkraut for  coleslaw and it came toasted. I also ordered the house chips which are homemade potato chips with salt and pepper.
So I got my sandwich and was surprised at how small it was. It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to. So I ignored the size and dove in. WOW! The bread was so good. Toasted without being dry, light. The meat was perfectly cooked, not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place, the coleslaw was so good and flavorful, juicy without dripping all over the place. The chips were also really good! Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size. It was so good I can't wait to go back!

When trying something new, I have learned not have any expectations, positive or negative,  until I have experienced it for myself. Otherwise, I've either felt let down because I expected too much or I didn't let myself have a good time because I nit picked everything.
Well for whatever reason I couldn't help but have high expectations of this place. Thankfully, it was one of the times where I was not let down!
I came here around 9 one night recently. I had heard about the long waits, so I had held off for a while but finally broke down and dragged a friend with me after work one night. She parked on the street, I valeted. For as busy as it was, my friend said there was plenty of street parking, I just wasn't paying attention. There was several cars in front of me, but the line moved fast, and I only had to wait a couple minutes before it was whisked off by some kid who probably just got his license last week (not complaining about skill, he just looked barely old enough to drive).
We walked right in and put our name on the list and had about a 30-45 min wait (which turned out to only be 25 min) so we walked to the bar ordered a couple drinks and went and sat in the adirondack chairs by the ping pong tables. We sat, talked, watched people playing ping pong and having a good time. The atmosphere was loud, fun, and happy.
Once we received the text that our table was ready, the hostedss walked us to our table and introduced our server who was friendly and sweet. we asked for recommendations and wound up ordering some cheese and pickeled peppers to start which where delicious.
For our entrees, I had the fish and chips and she had the corn canneloni. Wow! Seriously, some of the best fish and chips I have ever had. Light, buttery, flaky fish with flavorful, crunchy breading. My friends canneloni was delicious as well, I only tasted a bite (I was surprised I was allowed that much) so I can't go too in depth about its deliciousness, but I would definitely order it for myself next time.
The portions were big, I took one piece of fish, half my fries and all my cole slaw home and she took almost half of her dish home.
For pickeled peppers, cheese, fish and chips, canneloni and 4 glasses of wine, our bill was $68. I don't know what people are complaining about. I really don't.
The prices are typical, the portions were good sizes, the drinks were big, the service was impeccable and valet is pretty standard for central and downtown Phoenix. I absolutely loved the Yard and can't wait to come back. All of you haters can go back to your suburban Olive Gardens and Applebees.

Went last night for the first time as part of a group of 11 guys.  We were seated in a private dining room next to the wine cellar - very cool!

We went all out by ordering crab cakes and king crab appetizers - delicious.  Then everybody ordered their entrees and we picked three sides: lobster mac n cheese, asparagus and creamed spinach to share.  I had the 8 oz filet.  All the sides arrived piping hot and were served to us on the sizzling dinner plate that the steak was served on.  Interesting that as your steak was served they asked that you cut into it right through the middle to ensure that the doneness was as you ordered -  I never experienced that at a steak house.  Of course mine was cooked to specification at medium rare, appeared to be simply seasoned with salt/pepper and the meat was a wet aged prime cut that was as tender as it was flavorful.  We enjoyed Prisoner wine that complimented our meal wonderfully and the wine service was expert with the wine properly decanted and served from carafe.  Anxious to return for another meal here with my wife......the vibe in the bar with a piano player vocalist was good energy.

She steamed my flour tortilla, added my options then rolled it and placed it in a grill so it was slightly crispy & warm~ just heavenly to me. 
    Another nice feature is the full bar , I ordered a margarita, accepted an upgraded tequila recommendation from the bartender and it was possibly the BEST margarita I have EVER had!!! REALLY & only $7 bucks a total DEAL, in my opinion  
    I also like the decor of Taco y Taco. Clearly it is a restaurant, however it does have a clubby vibe, as I believe it was some sort of nightclub in a previous life.
   If your on Eastern near 215 check Taco y Taco it will make you feel Muy Bueno

If there was ever a business that I would point out as a 'model' for other businesses to follow, Istanbul Grille would be it, hands down!

First, their food is fresh, real, plentiful and absolutely delicious. Second, their prices are more than reasonable. And thirdly, and most importantly, their sense of customer service and 'hospitality' is as real and friendly as I have EVER seen in Pittsburgh - and they're from Turkey!

I'd been to two of their other locations, first when they were on Centre Avenue, and then after they'd moved to Lawrenceville, and both times, the staff and owner were so incredibly friendly, and the food, even though they'd had kitchen limitations, came out as a home cooked Turkish meal that was outstanding.

I tried the downtown lunch counter once after I'd started working downtown, and the thin and adorable guy behind the counter said 'first time?' I told him it was my first time at this location, and I ordered the 'meat' plate for the day. It came with their meat of the day, whatever is on the rotisserie (lamb or chicken) and he piled on the salads, the rice, some hummous, some hot sauce (which is more flavor than 'heat'), and a few other surprises. I don't even remember the price that day, but I had cash in my wallet, paid, and took it back to my office, and it was spectacular. 

But my second visit was even more amazing. I saw the credit card stickers on the door, and didn't have cash in my wallet. I ordered the meat plate with a little extra hummous, and when I got the food, I noticed they didn't seem to have a credit card terminal. I asked the owner if they took cards. He said 'We don't take anything. Not even money. The food is free.' I smiled but said 'Seriously' because I didn't have cash. He said 'Don't worry, just bring it when you can'. I thanked him profusely, and then ran to my co-worker who was buying dreck food at Subway and borrowed cash, and returned immediately.

He looked at me when I walked in the door and said 'Why don't you listen to me? I didn't say run now, I said when you can!'  A lady, who I assume is his mom or aunt came over, and I asked what the total was, and she said 'ten'. I handed her the nine I'd borrowed from my friend, and reached for my wallet. 'That's good' she said. I insisted on giving her the other dollar from my wallet, and thanked them all again. And as I made my way to the door, the owner yelled out 'Hey! Get yourself a soda!' Oh, and did I mention there was a line of twenty people both times?

I didn't take a soda, but I was so moved by their genuine realness, that there are no worries - if I have cash, I WILL be back.

If some of the businesses serving up crap in town were this genuine and nice, I might spend money on their wares anyway. They should take a lesson from Istanbul.

And Istanbul, along with remarkable friendliness, serves up remarkable food. Clearly, a win-win situation.

An added bonus is that if you happen to be attracted to dark Middle-Eastern and Indian/Asian types, the line is almost TOTAL eye candy. I fell in love three times just waiting in line.

No bull, just total yum - at Istanbul!

I do love a GOOD buffet, and quite frankly, around here 'good' is the keyword that is usually missing.  Pittsburgh has plenty of troughs called buffets, and for one price, stuffing yourself silly makes the low quality generally overlookable.  

By far, the BEST Asian buffet in da burgh is indeed Hokkaido.

At first glance, the menu board lists a price that makes you say 'this had better be worth it!', but once you get inside and experience the magnitude of the offerings, from the usual blase to some more unusual dishes, and you load your plate up again and again with tasty treats, you realize 'Yeah, it was worth it!'

First they have a salad section. You can have a simple salad to sate the 'inside the box' eaters, or you can have a woodear salad for the more adventurous. There's kimchee, squid salad and even marinated spicy chicken feet.  

Slide over a bin, and you have the peel and eat shrimp, crawdads and other such goodies.  

One more to the left begins the hot foods that are more akin to the general offerings at a Chinese buffet, like General Tsaos Chicken, Sprite Beef, rice noodles and stir fried rice, Rose Chicken, Frog Legs, and a variety of other hot dishes and stir fries.

Now we're in the corner where the line tends to clog over the crab legs.  I don't get that one personally.  SO much work for so little food, but the line for the crab legs is always a pain - but hey, squeeze by them, avoid the flying crackers, and now you're at the soup station.  Clam Chowder, Hot and Sour, Egg Drop, Wonton...they're all there.

Just to your left now is the 'do it yourself mixins' bin, next to the Hibachi grill.  Here, you pick the goodies you'd like, hand them to the cute little Latino behind the grill, and he hops and chops and grill your desired ingredients into a hot steaming mess of yum.

One more step to the left, and you reach the heat lamps keeping the 'total inside the box' eaters goods warm...polish sausage and a roast beef or pork.  

Once again, step to the left, and you've got the appetizers bin.  Crab Rangoon, pot stickers, chicken-on-a-stick, stuffed mushrooms, quesadillas, fried shrimp, stuffed crab shells, sesame buns, and even pizza for the 'Ewww, I don't like that other stuff' people.

After you put your first three plates down on the table, return to this same spot, shuffle to the left, and you're at the Sushi station. Oodles of varieties of little rice balls with raw and cooked goodies stuffed in the middle, with all of the sauces to make your tongue screech with heat, or tingle with salt. 

Chew, rinse and repeat.  It's a buffet.  

Finally, just before the hallway to the bathroom, all the way down at the end, is the dessert station. Cakes, fresh fruit and a chocolate fountain, ice creams, and dessert fungus and lychees,

Their soda products are COKE (hooray!), but they also have brewed iced tea, the hot green teas and regular teas.  

The staff of 'waitresses' are more like glorified bus persons (they have very few cute Asian guys on the floor - they're mostly in the back doing the stir-frying), but they do keep your glasses full and empty plates scooped away.

I've eaten here many times, and I'm always impressed by the amount of Asian people eating here. You will also see more than a 'few' people who obviously eat here regularly - and they're a good reminder that this is something to do 'once in a while'.

I have never been disappointed. The food is always fresh, and very flavorful, and there is a little something for everyone - all tastes can be sated.

The funniest thing I ever experienced at Hokkaido happened before the strip mall was even completely built. On the outside of the building was a HUGE vinyl banner proclaiming (and indeed, I quote): "COMING SOON - JUMBO SEAFOOD BUFFEET"

Fortunately, their lack of a proofreader was NOT an omen of things to come.  Hokkaido does everything else right.

This was one of eight or nine Michaels Stores we went to in the greater Phoenix area today. This was a little on the smaller side and less clean than most of the Michaels we go to.  We were searching for a particular type of scrapbooking paper that my wife uses in her paper crafting. As with the other locations, we really didn't find any. They all seem to be out of stock of this particular paper. In addition, the paper section needed some straightening. There were lots of pages in the wrong spot, and the paper we were looking for had the slots filled with different colored papers. That may be why the stock ran out and was overlooked.

We stopped in here today just to check it out. We usually like Ross and go there fairly often when my wife is shopping for clothes. This location was pretty standard as far as Ross's go. The store was pretty clean, there were a lot of staff working, and the checkout line moved relatively quickly even though long. We went to this particular Ross because we were over in that area of the city, but wouldn't necessarily make a special trip out that way just to go to this location. I will say however, that our cashier was extremely friendly, and not just in the fake friendly way that a lot of people put on for work. If you're in the area, definitely check them out.

If you find yourself lost in the greater Arizona area and longing for some Southern style fried chicken, scoot on over to Lo-Lo's and completely ruin yourself for any other fried chicken ever again.  This is seriously the best fried chicken place we've been to since leaving Florida, and we've been to 19 states and the District of Columbia eating our way across America. We've been to two of their locations, but here we had Deandre as our server at this one, and he was great.

Believe me when I tell you, you haven't had sweet tea until you've had it southern style (i.e. - so much sugar you almost pucker), and they do it well here.  They even serve Kool-Aid in mason jars (as with all of their drinks).  The chicken is breaded with a tantalizing blend of spices and deep fried (can I get a "hell yeah!"), and you can't go wrong with any of their sides. My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and I miss this restaurant more than any others since moving away from Phoenix!

I'm going to dedicate a separate paragraph (gasp!) for the banana pudding.  Scandalous, I know.  Remember all that traveling I told you about in the first paragraph?  I've never found ANYWHERE with banana pudding this good.  It's big enough to share, but we each get our own. You should too. It's that good. I haven't even found a place IN THE SOUTH with banana pudding this good, including my grandma's house (although if you tell her that I will deny it to my last breath).

I'm not going to tell you that you should make a a special Trip to Phoenix for Lo-Lo's, but you should totally make a a special Trip to Phoenix for Lo-Lo's.  Road trip?  Lo-Lo's.  Layover in Phoenix?  Extend it and go to Lo-Lo's.  Live on Earth?  Go to Lo-Lo's.

I ordered abut 500 mini cupcakes for my wedding without doing a tasting at all!  I actually had never even had any cupcakes at Vanilla Pastry Studio.  I simply went off of yelp reviews, and their interesting unique flavors.  I was not disappointed, and neither were my guests!  The service at Vanilla Pastry is wonderful.  They were quite helpful over the phone, and understood that I didn't have time to come in for a tasting.  Everything was package perfectly, and you could taste that it had been baked that day.  Everyone at the wedding reception was raving over them.  Since then I have stopped by their shop multiple times to treat myself occasionally.  Their cupcakes are unbelievably moist, seriously... I have no idea how they do it!  I recently went to another wedding where they had done a cupcake tower, again they did a stellar job.  If just want a treat, or a large order this is definitely the place to go.  I just wish they had multiple locations, like dozen.  I would definitely pick this place over dozen any day.    

My wedding order was:

1. Mango-Passionfruit
2. Vanilla - Dulce de Leche
3. Chocolate - Raspberry
4. Vanilla Chocolate
5. Vanilla - Vanilla

They allowed me to pick theme colors for the balls on top too.  It matched perfectly!

Just stopped in this morning and go two bagels to go.  One everything with garlic & herb cream cheese, and a "super" cinnamon w/ walnut and raisin cream cheese.  The cream cheese on these suckers were amazing, a huge difference between store bought.  The bagel on the other hand was good - not great, so three stars it is.  I paid around $5 for the two bagels, so they weren't cheap either.  All and all a solid bagel place.

I learned about this place from DH while we started dating.   He had dared to show me something beautiful about Pittsburgh that I had never seen before on our second date.  I didn't think it was possible since he wasn't a Pittsburgh native.  Apparently most Pittsburgh natives don't know about this place - how sad!  I was blow away by the view.  In my opinion it's much better than Mount Washington, and it's now a place we regularly take our guests to see.

Um really, 2 1/2 stars for this joint?!?  I'm shocked just shocked!  I noticed their Smithfield location is 4 stars, and this seems more inline with what I think.  However I'm reviewing here, because this is the location that I frequent most, since it's only a few blocks from my workplace.  

This is my group's place, at least once a week!  The hot fresh salty chips with the spicy cilantroyee salsa is muy yum!  Table side guac, yes please... with extra jalapenos.  This is most certainly a lunch place, the service is fast & efficient, and the food is fresh & yummy.  I have eaten here for dinner before, and they are not known for their alcoholic drinks, and aren't uber busy during those hours.  I would stick to their lunch hour to be guaranteed a fantastic AUTHENTIC new Mexican meal.  Must tries: TABLE SIDE guac, chicken enchiladas with just about any sauce, quesadillas, and their taco salad.  MUY MUY YUM!

I think this is probably one of the most popular restaurants between locals. Dw Bistro is a restaurant that combines Mexican and Jamaican cuisine creating a cool spin to the most common dishes. They are open for lunch, dinner and brunch during the weekends. If you are planning to go for dinner especially during the weekend reservations are highly recommended. What I love the most about this place is their weekend brunch. For only $20 you can get unlimited mimosas, thats definitely an awesome deal. Some of their best dishes are the Chilaquiles, the Jerk Hash and the Chicken and Waffles. You cannot go wrong with most of their dishes. Their food has a great and unique taste. If you have not been here yet, you must come and see what the buzz is all about.

This review is for the restaurant!
The decor is pleasant, very nice atmosphere and great service. We ordered the carpaccio which was very good, however, this one had horseradish which makes some bites a bit overwhelming. I ordered the pesce plate and it was horrible! The pieces of fish were lacking flavor. In addition, the fish was charred so i was not a big fan of the flavor. Even the vegetables were not very good! It's hard to write a review for a place that has nice ambiance and great customer service but the food was not up to par.

Unfortunately, they do not have all you can eat options which makes this place a bit pricey. Each exceptional roll is between $12-$16 dollars which could add up pretty fast. The decor and atmosphere are very nice and modern. The service is also good, fast and very efficient. Overall, I would recommend  this sushi in the summerlin area.

I have been to the WW in Asheville I Guess more than 30 times always great food service and drinks. BUT... there is something about The WW At this location and one other it seems like it must be KFC.
     IT all started about 230pm I guess I had passed by this location a few times but, decided to stop. They had a all u can eat wing and soup I think (I am trying to forget). FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now"HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.
          I called their Corp office and spoke with "David" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..
         So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING? Again he invited me to the location on Ardslye his FLAGSHIP LOCATION NOT ANY BETTER I GAVE UP ON WILD WINGS IN THIS AREA

My original review for Ruan Siam found its way to Street Box's page... so until we get that sorted, here it is in all it's glory (plus a star, because for a few weeks this past year, I basically lived off this.):

The Lazy Gal's Bible.
Entry #50:

I go to great lengths to avoid cooking on a regular basis, so I feel like i've become a bit of an expert when it comes to take out/delivery options. Of the thai i've tried, this place currently ranks in my top spot.

It's a tiny little place, tucked under the stairs as you make your way into Stockbridge. All of five or six tables, I was pleasantly surprised when I popped my head in the door last week - it's cozy and cute. Would make an excellent little date spot, if you aren't like me and a lazy sod who prefers pad thai to be accompanied by pajamas.

My first go round, I wasn't overly impressed. I got the vegetarian spring rolls and a stir fried option with crispy chicken (the name escapes me and I can't seem to find it on their online, so just keep "crispy chicken" top of mind when you peruse) and I would pass on both in the future. The spring rolls were half decent, but definitely nothing special and the stir fry was kind of like the microwave stir fry options you get at the shop (and remember: expert on this stuff). It was decently tasty but entirely unmemorable and definitely not enough to coax me back.

Except, as stated time and time again: i'm lazy.

Which means, on a Thursday night when i'm craving thai food and this is the closest/offers online ordering/delivery spot in the neighbourhood? I'm going to give them a second chance.

Gosh, I'm glad i'm lazy sometimes! My second take out experience from this place was miles better than the first. 

For my second go round, I kept it safe with chicken satay, vegetarian pad thai and sticky rice. Let's break it down:

Chicken satay: this may be the best satay i've ever had. It comes with a peanut sauce and a cucumber sauce and just go ahead and dump that all over your meat on sticks. It's delicious and well balanced - but extremely messy. Hence why this would make a perfect take out (anyone who sees you dribble sauce, already likes you enough to watch you eat in your pajamas) but a pass for date night munchies (dribble privileges come later).

Vegetarian pad thai - i'm one of those obnoxious people that roll their eyes when people order pad thai because it's so "unadventurous" but consider me smacked upside the head. This dish is incredibly tasty. It's also nice to see they're making it with proper tamarind sauce.

Sticky rice - ok, this is going to sound loopy, but this was my favourite. It's surprisingly easy to mess up sticky rice and this was both a good portion and an excellent midnight snack. Throw some left over peanut sauce on that bad boy and you have snacking excellence. I will definitely swing by for more of this in my lazy future.

So consider me turned - I am definitely a fan of this little spot and am quite happy that I gave it a second chance. It's a solid choice for lazy guys/gals everywhere (within 5 miles...)

Pretty good bbq place. The ribs were darn good. My friend didn't even add bbq sauce to hers. 

The green beans are pretty good, made with turkey thigh. Mac and cheese was delicious! How can you go wrong with Mac and Cheese though? Super good. 

I ordered the brisket dinner and it was quite yummy. I used a ton of bbq sauce, because I like a little brisket with my sauce.  I tried the spicy bbq sauce (you have to ask for it), but it was a little too spicy for me. 

Cole slaw was pretty good, but I didn't like Cincinnati Chili fries. I mean the fries were ok, but the chili was not for me. Blah

Overall pretty good meal. Kind of expensive at about $18 per meal. But I think it's about the same at most bbq places.

My review will strictly be on what I ordered:

The Box Combo - Shared this with a friend and it was the perfect amount.  I'll start with the chicken fingers.  Obviously freshly battered and fried which makes a huge difference in the overall quality of the product.  Moist, tender, crispy, and simply seasoned.  The Canes sauce goes heavy on the cracked pepper, which I didn't mind at all.  The fries will crinkle cut fries which I think are fitting to the type of meal that is being served.  The coleslaw was pretty standard and on the sweet side.  The toast well...... I mean who doesn't love a warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside thick piece of white bread with butter slathered on one side? YUM!

OVERALL:  Pretty good place for what it is.  You don't find places that focus on chicken fingers so it's a great alternative for those who aren't so much into the 93457203975209384 burger joints in this country.

Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!

Just because you are in Vegas don't expect to wine and dine here.  This is meant to be a quick service restaurant with food to satisfy hunger, not give you the "wow" factor.

Had the prosciutto sandwich and it tasted just as I anticipated.  Crusty baguette, prosciutto di parma, mozzarella, arugula, and balsamic.  Simple, fast, and on the go.  The cheese pizza would have used some extra time in the oven because the under crust had gone soggy.

Who said that KFC is the only chicken in town that is finger licking good? I have to say that is not true. The finger sized chicken wings either bone in or bone out are the best finger popping chicken I have ever had. The freshly made never frozen chicken takes a while to cook but is worth the wait. I believe there are 12 different flavors to choose as a wing sauce or seasoning. My favorite is the Lemon Pepper. Taste like home cooked fried chicken with some good ole seasoning. The fries freshly cut from real potatoes are a great partner in crime to the mouth. These tasty skins are packed with seasoning in every bite. 

The Resturant offers meal deals or individual food items for sale. You can purchase party platters for big football days when friends and family come. 

This location has its liquor license so you can purchase ice cold bottles beer besides soda. 

The Resturant has late hours and a big screen TV. Place to take the kiddos too. Plenty of food fun here...

Having enjoyed several meals at this Italian Seafood specialist, our expectations were extraordinarily high. And for the most part, Chef Paul and his supremely professional delivered. Our group of 12 was seated at perhaps the best location in the entire place-the center cabana by the pool...which allowed us to view the entire restaurant through the glass doors and a panoramic view of the poolside restaurant as well. 

Our group opted for the top level chef tasting menu which includes a variety of shellfish (and of course the coveted langoustines which are tagged and monitored from ocean to table), a pasta course, the main fish course and a family style dessert tasting. If you've never dined here, pay close attention to the presentation at the beginning. It is obvious they take great care to source their Mediterranean Sea creatures and fly them in over no more than 48hrs. They also stress that the food is not fancy...it is just super fresh and prepared and served in a homey more rustic preparation. That said, your taste buds will sing after feasting on the octopus, scallops, barnacles, shrimp and super sweet langoustines. Our pasta course featured a penne with seafood in a red sauce, a gorgeous pappardelle with mushrooms, the signature cheese ravioli which were so delicate they melt in your mouth and my favorite-a squid ink risotto which was knock your socks off good. I am not a huge fan of pasta in general but it is hard not to appreciate the deft hand and the al Dente preparations here. In case you're still hungry, they filleted sizable John Dory table side which is presented in this beautiful thick salt crust. And boy is that fish flakey white and simply delicious. 

The dessert course was really overwhelming but we all forced ourselves to taste a bite of each- sorbetto and gelato, a berry compote panna cotta, an olive oil cake doused in rum, a chocolate mouse of sorts and my pick-the semifreddo on a chocolate cookie crust with a dried prune topping-sensational. 

The wine list is impressive and we deferred to the sommelier for some Italian selections. Here is a tip: bottle prices can climb quickly but if you stick with the ones recommended for under $100 each you won't go wrong...promise. 

Service was absolutely fantastic. Attentive, knowledgable and friendly. If you appreciate what Chef Paul has done with this exquisite seafood Mecca then the tab shouldn't surprise you. Fabulous food in a gorgeous setting served by the most professional staff..and the portions will absolutely fill your belly. Just don't expect to spend less than $150 at minimum per person for this unique culinary experience. Thank you, Bartolotta for another wonderful dining experience. Wish you would come to NYC!!!

Having enjoyed several meals at this Italian Seafood specialist, our expectations were extraordinarily high. And for the most part, Chef Paul and his supremely professional delivered. Our group of 12 was seated at perhaps the best location in the entire place-the center cabana by the pool...which allowed us to view the entire restaurant through the glass doors and enjoy a  panoramic view of the poolside restaurant as well. 

Our group opted for the top level chef tasting menu which includes a variety of shellfish (and of course the coveted langoustines which are tagged and monitored from ocean to table), a pasta course, the main fish course and a family style dessert tasting. If you've never dined here, pay close attention to the presentation at the beginning. It is obvious they take great care to source their Mediterranean Sea creatures and fly them in over no more than 48hrs. They also stress that the food is not fancy...it is just super fresh and prepared and served in a homey more rustic preparation. That said, your taste buds will sing after feasting on the octopus, scallops, barnacles, shrimp and super sweet langoustines.

It seems like I've always had bad luck with Dior. 



I ordered a pink new lock pouch from NY boutique , the bag arrived with a minor damage so I returned back to the boutique with no problem.



I then ordered the exact same bag from Las Vegas boutique on May 9th , the bag arrived on May 15th . The bag did not came with a box , only a dust bag . (Manager explained to me the clutch does not come in a box, but the one from NY did ) Then on the right side of the bag had a dent and the without box issue seemed weird to me , so i returned the bag . 



I mailed out on may 18th , before mailing out I texted the SA that sold the bag to me . He disappeared !  Did not return any of my message!!!!!!!  I called about a week later  checking up on the process, another lady SA answered my call , she told me I cannot get a refund because it was pass the 10 day return period. I explained that the shipping take time, just like how when I ordered the bag on the 9th but didn't get it till the 15th !!  She told me she would talk with a manager and call me back, and guess what ? She disappeared too!



I called the las vegas boutique this morning and luckily the manager answered the phone, I thought finally someone I could talk to. She told me she could not do a return ( because its rare) exchange only and if i want a store credit , it needs approval and it takes a long time. I explained to her that NY did a refund , she then gave me an attitude about how they" received on time" ( no , it was the exact same situation) "why can't you just get a new bag " 



I have NEVER EVER encountered this kind of poor customer service . 



Oh and guess what she said by the end ? " I will call you back "

Excusing the pretentious capitalization of this restaurant, I must say my meal was perfect. Went with family, had the salmon. Cooked to perfection and was accompanied by some sort of risotto like pasta with crack cocaine butter on it. I plowed the whole thing down like there was no tomorrow. And that was after their delicious house bread and special butter. Good stuff, this place.

Was finally able to try this new sushi joint tonight with a friend and really enjoyed it.  We had three rolls, two off the menu and one a "chef's special."  All three rolls were tasty, and I appreciate their use of soypaper and cucumber rather than an excess of rice.  We also shared a sake and had miso soups, and our bill came out to just under $50.  We had a lot to catch up on and sat at our booth for over two hours, and never felt like we were holding up the staff.  They refilled our waters continuously, which I always appreciate when I'm at a restaurant past the point of ordering additional food items.  I will 100% be back.

Located at the end of the strip, I can see people completely skipping by this place. There's nothing too flashy from the outside like a pyramid at Luxor or the Eiffel Tower at Paris, but the building can easily be mistaken for any of the other big name hotels on the strip with gold tinted windows.

I stayed here with my family during Spring Break and the rooms we got were super nice. Huge beds, clean room, flat screen, and a nice view overlooking the pool beneath (One un-heated, one heated, and one hot tub).

I really didn't like that there wasn't free wifi and the fitness room cost an additional $20 or so, but I guess in Vegas, everything's gotta cost something right?

I'd would stay here again and be happy :) Not overcrowded like many of the other hotels I stayed at.

I am not sure if they planned the location of this theater well. The parking lot is actually pretty small for a place with 12 screens. Parking was an issue on a Sunday afternoon. 

For most people, this is a new type of theater. They need more greeters at the front to explain to people what needs to be done. I have dealt with reservation type of theaters and was all set with my tickets already. 

The prices for tickets and concessions are still in line with the old Marcus location. However, now any size soda or slushie entitles the holder to unlimited free refills. The soda machines are great! You pick from one of 6 flavors for each type. However, there are only four of them. So most people are staring in awe of the options while the rest of us wait in line. 

I have not tried the food or drinks yet. More on that later. If you are trying to save money they still do $5 early movies.

We took a taxi out to come visit this place and it was well worth it. 
We had three burgers

Oxtail chili fries 
Spicy miso
Miyagi San grass fed Waygu 
Kiki 

Of the 4, by far, oxtail fries was amazingly good. I love oxtail and this was a great take on it! 

As for the burgers, I really enjoyed the Kiki the best. The mushrooms and the sauce had a lot of flavor. 

The one they sell the most was the miyagi, which was good, the crunch from the onion rings were good, and the flavor of the yolk mixed well. 

Spicy miso for me was just another burger. The shredded lettuce overpowered the whole burger, and wasn't the most pleasant over power flavor. 

The burgers were really big. Between three people this was more than enough food, I think 5 people could have split all this food and had a good bite of each and still be just full. 

I think for flavor, I still like Unami burger for the juiciness of the meat, but I think you get more value and more uniqueness for what you pay.

The only reason we were in the Luxor was to see the Criss Angel show which was a total waste of money.  Company actually served really good food and the hostess hooked us up with free entrance for our entire group of 10 to the club LAX.  I have to say that the hookup was really nice considering it was me and 9 guys.  No one ever wants to let guys in for free...especially little Asian guys since they can't really drink that much before turning red and throwing up.  The club must be really hurting...but back to Company - food and service were both excellent and I highly recommend the Kobe sliders that came on sweet Hawaiian bread, the spiced fries and the pork sandwich - YUM YUM YUM

This is fusion Japanese and South American and it's done well.  Many fusion places taste really weird, but this one was pretty good.  The waiter was a little misinformed.  I bet you he couldn't find Japan or Brazil on a globe.  We tried the toro, tuna, yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and lemongrass, the kanpachi sashimi plate with truffle oil and sea salt, and the Bobo Brazil roll - beef carpaccio and avocado basically.  Everything was delicious.  

To finish off we tried 2 desserts :  the chocolate banana taquitos that came with chocolate banana filling in a sugar shell that was crunchy and flaky and the hot melted chocolate and churros which were more like skinny crackers than traditional churros. The taquitos were good and the churros wer a rip off. Service was decent.  Ambiance was excellent and at night it turns into a bar / lounge.  The workers were good looking.

Reviewing Mexican Food Restaurants in Phoenix is a little like sports talk radio folks trying to compare boxers.  There are so many differences.  How do you compare a boxer in the heavy weight division to a boxer who fights in the welter weight division?   How do you compare a light weight to a super-light weight? It's hard.  and it's difficult to do with Mexican Restaurants as well.  When attempting to talk about boxing there is a term people like to use, "Pound for Pound", meaning if they weighed the same, this boxer would be superior.  

"Pound for Pound" the Tee Pee is my favorite Mexican Resturant in the Valley.  Sure, there is a place in Scottsdale that has Green Corn Tamales that are to die for.  LOS DOS, in South Phoenix makes some killer dishes with Hatch Chilles.  But overall if I could only eat at one Mexican food place the rest of my life The Tee Pee would be it. 

The Green Chile Burros are excellent.  The Margs are fantastic and everyone I have ever taken there loves the Salsa.  I especially like the Cheese Crisps and when ever I go there I just ask for the daily special, which they have been serving for like 50 years.  A Taco, Enchilada, Tostada combo.  Wonderful.  Check out the Tee Pee, a family run restaurant who is serious about their food.

I've been here a few times now and Bachi has not yet disappointed.  If you wanna come for a premium burger that tastes even more awesome on an egg bun, do come and check out Bachi and try it out.  For me, it's been the Miyagi Wagyu burger for the win each time...but the last time we were there, one of the servers told us that the burger that all the staff has and swears by is the miso wagyu burger...he said to definitely try it the next time we come out there.

And as an added bonus, they joined up with the ramen joint a few months ago and now serve both on their menus.  I come here for the burgers, but you know me and my love relationship with ramen; so of course I tried it out too...just the tonkatsu though.  The broth wasn't as tasty as I had expected, but the chasu was prob one of the best I've had...nice and fatty and super tender.  If you can split it amongst your group, I'd definitely go for it.

The fries: sweet potato, truffle, oxtail, and regular, are all awesome, and DEFINITELY can feed more than one person, as we learned to our doom the first time we came in and each ordered fries.  The oxtail is quite heavy so you might wanna split the burger...but then again, this is vegas, INDULGE!!!!

This place can get absolutely packed, which is a sign of the good food, the popularity of the burger, and just the fact that Bachi rules!  So I would come at non-peak times, which is hard to determine for Vegas, Thursday night at around 10 the wait was 40 minutes, Saturday around 9:30 the wait was 5...so it really does follow along with the vegas theme of just gettin lucky.  

PS - there's a new bigger spot also about 15 min away from the strip...but with traffic, can actually take much longer to get to, but if this place is too busy, at least you have a second option.  

Staff - Great!  Esp with the recommendations and the good humor.  Thanks Bachi! :)

Never really thought to try and even find a ramen house in Vegas, considering, one typically is drunk and just walking about the strip all day long, but this place was DEFINITELY a good find.  Chanced upon this quaint little establishment while visiting friends in Vegas and they recommended that we should eat here because I loved noodles so much.  Definitely comparable to my favorite ramen places...5 stars as far as Vegas is concerned!  :)

I was a little skeptic at first, but walking into this tiny little place, which probably seats no more than 20 - 30 guests, was one of the pleasant little surprises of my trip.  

Ordered the Gyoza and the Tonkotsu ramen with the hard boiled egg.  The gyoza...typical.  The ramen was actually quite good.  The noodles were nice and soft, and the broth was flavorful and not too much.  The yolk of the egg was pretty salty, even for my taste(and I LOVE salty), but the Chasu...MAN, I don't know exactly how they cooked it, but it was frickin good.  I ate all of my ramen and my fiancee's leftovers and was so full, but would've still eaten some more, just because I liked it so much.  

I can definitely see this place getting quite busy at peak times, considering the size and all, so come outside of the meal rush hours.  

Service - good.  No complaints and nothing especially out of the ordinary either.  

Parking is fine, the place shares a large lot with several other establishments...

The five stars are for the pharmacy at this location. Lamontae and the other younger guy are awesome. I must use this Walgreens a lot because they both greet me by my first name every time I walk in which is nice. When an employee takes the time to remember your name it's a nice personal touch that I enjoy. I am always welcomed with a smile and friendly attitude when shopping here or picking up medicine. The store is like every other basic Walgreens. This location has a minute clinic  with a PA who can take care of most basic health needs. The pharmacy has a drive up window if you don't feel like going in the store. I like how it's open 24/7 both the store and pharmacy.

It's sad to say that the quality of this hotel has drastically decreased. I stayed here with a group for the 3rd time during the magic trade expo (we like to stay here because of the cleanliness, spacious rooms, and ease of traveling to/from the expo). We had a 5 rooms for 4 nights, plus 2 additional rooms for 2 nights. Needless to say, every room had at least one issue...

1. Room had dirty room service dishes upon arrival.
2. Room had dust all over the wood floors.
3. (My) room, coffee cups and glassware I used was never replaced, only removed by housekeeping.
4. Room was too small for husband, wife n daughter (12y) had requested room with 2 beds. Couldn't be changed after check in.
5. Used toiletries were not replaced by housekeeping.

Upon complaining to the front desk (night shift, we were at the expo all day) they managed to wave some of our resort fees, but still didn't feel accommodating as we were not utilizing any of the benefits included in the resort fees. 

All in all, we were disappointed as a group and will not be returning for the next expo.

This is a lively restaurant. It was Tuesday night during the week of the magic fashion trade show and it was a packed restaurant. Everything we ordered was delicious. See the pics. The service was excellent and the manager even came by to see how we were doing. The group I was with routinely comes to this restaurant every time they are in Vegas because they love the food so much. There is some lovely outdoor seating and the restaurant is nestled within a beautiful outdoor shopping center.

This place gets 1 star for location. The food is premade as they get busy during lunch time. The only thing warm are the fries. You're order comes out too quickly (they don't even try to hide the fact that the food is premade).

Overall, a horrible representation Jonny Rockets! :-(

Don't have enough good things to say about this place.  We don't like Chinese buffets normally because many times food has set too long.  This places was amazing!  Everything was hot, fresh and tasty.  We've only been once and that was on a Friday night.  We pigged out on clams, crab legs and shrimp and so many other good items.  All I can say is FANTASTIC.  We'll be back!

(note: this is reposted from another listing of this establishment)

I love the Huntridge.  It's a great little neighborhood dive, stress on the dive.  The drinks are crazy cheap (like $3 for call liquor?!), and they always have weekly specials.  The bartenders are friendly and entertaining, and the working-class clientele is refreshingly unpretentious and relaxed.  

Warning: it is smoky as all get out in there, and smells like smoke even when it's empty! So if you're sensitive to that, don't go here.  

They have a great jukebox, random bar snacks, and an array of bar video games to entertain the drunkards.  I always seem to gravitate toward this place around 2-4 am because it's right on my way home from pretty much anywhere else.  

The Huntridge is open 24-hours, but if you feel the need to take the party elsewhere, you can always buy 6-packs or bottles of liquor to go!

Update: they've started having a Weds night game night, where people get together and play Apples to Apples, UNO, or whatever might be of interest.  Great way to meet new folks!

One-stop shop for all kinds of cool things to do downtown! Art? (Duh).  There are several galleries here with a wide variety of styles to enjoy.  Vegan-friendly dining (or meat, if you must)? Bar and Bistro has you covered!  They'll also hook you up with booze, and great dog-friendly patio.  Yoga? Blue Sky has classes every day, drop in, for donation! Need some personal grooming? The awesome Hilary Salon is on the 2nd floor, and provides a variety of service for men, women, and kiddos.  That's why I look so good, y'all! Feeling whimsical? There are awesome toy, jewelry, and comic shops there as well! (Panda Toys, Hiptazmic, HellPop).  

It's a the cool place to be on First Friday for live musical performances and drinks.  (But if you really like art and want to appreciate it, go on preview Thursday to beat the crowds and enjoy the special Thursday happy hour and B&B!)

Disappointing. Waitress took 15 minutes before I flagged them down. They took my order but no follow up and waiting another 10 minutes to get my check. I had the chicken nachos which were average. Did not like my drink the Sergio. Was way heavy on the tequila and not refreshing and light which is what I was hoping with the fruit juice and mint.

Note - if this review seems similar, please see my review of the Rosati's on Chayenne as I posted this review there first before realizing the location.  I left it up because I have tried both places and the quality is similar!  

Craving Chicago Style Pizza?  Well look no further, just bring a truck to get your leftovers home.  Their breadsticks are to die for.  Garlicky, yet not greasy, small, almost french fry size but light and crispy.  We got an antipaasti salad which wasn't very creative but was delicious.  I should have stopped there.  Salad and breadsticks would have filled me up but we came for the deep dish.  My wife mistakenly ordered the medium deep dish.  Having had Chicago Pizza at its birthplace in Chicago (Gino's or Giordanos??? another time.), I was certain a medium would be about the size of a normal plate and deep.  Instead it was about the size of a large flat crust pizza except deep!  The crust was perfectly crisp and the dough light.There was a lot of flavor and not a lot of grease which is good for a deep dish.  The dining area is small but the Pizza worth the wait.

Ok, we aren't done yet, my daughter wanted pasta so we got her Penne (knock knock Penne, Knock Knock Penne).  Another truck arrived at our table and delivered a trough full of delicious pasta.  They will alter the dish as my daughter wanted melted mozzerella on top. They happily obliged.

So, we carted home 1/2 a salad, 6/8 of a pizza and 2/3 of the pasta for lunch and dinner for the rest of the week.   Did I mention that with drinks the whole meal for three cost $49.00. 

Why not five stars?  Well the atmosphere is not the greatest, the place is small and they don't have as many topping choices as I would like.  But if you are craving good pizza and pasta that won't break the wallet, this is the place to go.

Excuse me while I catch my breath from running on the treadmill.  Ok. I have been a member of nearly every gym, Golds, 24hour, LAfitness, Fitness 19, etc. Now I joined LVAC.  This is like the Costco of gyms.  There is something for everyone here, in large quantities but the place is huge and you are not always sure where the things you need are.  The best way to descibe the place is to follow my workout. (sorry women, I am not allowed in the women's only workout room so I can't expound on it.

First, when I arrive, I drop my daughter off at child care.  This place has the best child care I have ever seen for a gym and it is one of the options to include in your membership.  They even have a special card with your child's photo and yours on it so there can be no mistaken release of the kids.  They have the pipes and slides, video games, multiple TV's, a little kids area and games.  Several staff members are there at all times.  And there is a multi camera video feed to watch later.

Next, I show my id and work my way past the juice bar (separate review) and up the stairs.  Just before the stairs is the free weight and universal machine room but I'll come back there later.  Up for cardio.  Past the racquetball courts and to the left is the cardio warehouse.  Row after row of machines.  Early in the morning it looks like Sears is having a sale.  Lifecycles, Treadmills, Stairmaster, Rowing, Bycicles, you name it.  A video display that rivals NASA is up front providing a plethora of viewing options right out of Back to the Future 2.  There is barely room to walk between the rows and when it is crowded, you sometimes feel like you are in a cattle run.  Bring headphones so you can listen to your TV of choice, music, or simply shut out the sound around you.

30 minutes of cardio later, it is time for Core.  LVAC has the latest Core equipment that isolates your muscles for both focused training and to preserve your back.  I could go into all the different machines but heck there are just too many.  Run around the indoor track then down for some bench presses, dips and chinups or leg workouts upstairs depending on the day.

Then jump in the pool for a few laps and you have the perfect workout. (I haven't gotten in the pool yet, but soon.)

Pros - Tons of equipment, even when crowded there is always space.  Friendly staff, and great kids area.  The place is well maintained and rarely is equipment out of order.  They have a stationary bike room and a group class room as well with a varied schedule.  I am not a muscle king and yet even when crowded I did not feel self conscious about working out like I do at some gyms.

Cons - the trainers do not seem very knowledgeable.  In fact, although I get free training every month as part of my plan, the trainer refused to allow me to direct the focus of the training.  The trainer was honest and told me the center makes them follow a "script" that only allows minimal alteration.  Maybe after a few more sessions they will deviate from the plan but I need specific help and didn't get it from my first two sessions.  I am not certain the trainers even have any certifications.    Also, as others have noted, if you haven't been here before, it is not easy to get to.  You don't have to uturn to get to LVAC but you do have to turn on Grand Canyon and then make a left at the back of the shopping center by the hotel.  You beat the traffic this way rather than drive through the shopping center.  The parking lot is large but expect to do some walking to get into the gym unless you get lucky.

I chose LVAC because of the multiple convenient locations and the much cheaper rate than Lifetime Fitness.

4.5 stars really. The only 1/2 star is held back for the long wait each time we go and occasionally the smoker that stands by your table if you have to sit outside. 
However, the food and general customer service is really fab-u-lous.  We've had breakfast and lunch and each time everything is always good. I love the veggie omelet and the salads are great, too. My kids love the pancakes and French toast.

Pretty nice to have a place during in-climate weather or on days where you'll be gone all day to take your furbaby. The first day is free, they do a personality test on your pooch to make sure they get along with the other daycare pooches. Then you get another 3 free days (not sure why, but I'll take it!)  it's $25 a day if you're there an hour or all day, drop off is 6 am I think, and pick up is 7pm.  They offer boarding packages ranging from the $30's up to around $50/ night.  I haven't used them for boarding, just daycare. 
They have an indoor warehouse and outdoor play area where they rotate dogs, separated big dogs from little dogs. The dogs take a 2 hour nap around lunch (which they don't actually eat, they just nap) in kennels, then back out for playtime. There are multiple handlers watching the dogs at all times, cleaning up potty messes and supervising friendly play. 
My dog always comes home tired, kind of dirty (they do offer grooming onsite for an extra cost), but is happy when I take her back the next time.

One thing I can say about this part of Henderson is you really feel like you're in Henderson. Located by The District and extending down a mile or so, this nice walking path is something I do in lieu of the gym or yoga or leaving reviews here in Yelp.... I walk my dog here a couple times a month and I must say it is a nicely maintained, clean path that has nice shade from trees and lots of green grass and plants to please the eye.

This review is for the salon services. 
I came here to get my hair highlighted. I had bad roots and wanted more of a full coverage look. I asked my stylist, Gloria, if I should dye my whole head or highlight. She suggested highlighting then she would go in with a root touch up. This sound like a good idea to me. 
Gloria was super friendly and I really wanted to like her. 
She took off the towel for the grand reveal and right away I told her it was too light and brassy. I had to ask for toner. Asking for toner as a blonde is my #1 pet peeve. I expect stylists to know to use it, and I shouldn't have to suggest it.
Anyway she used toner which helped a little in toning down the brassiness but the color was terrible. She kept explaining I wasn't used to seeing my roots covered which I felt was true. I went home still not happy.

the result left me crying...seriously crying in my room for days.

I called back to see if the damage could be fixed before going back to New York. At this point my hair was yellow like a pineapple. Still crying went to the salon met with another stylist. She told me we can't do anything. NOTHING. Except wash it and hope it fades. I was terrified. We went for a washing and my hair was still yellow.

She explained another customer came in with the same problem, they tried fixing it but dyed her hair purple instead. yikes. Seems like they have a major problem. 

The new stylist tried to charge me for a wash....a wash?!?! 

I left again crying over my yellow hair that couldn't be fixed. Went home and googled solutions. Using purple shampoo came up. So I did just that.  And fixed my hair myself.

I'm pretty disappointed the stylist didn't give me this tip. It would've been nice since ulta is a beauty supply store for her to suggest purple shampoo and a product while there, but nope. Luckily, I had purple shampoo at home. It's a hair saver.

Never again will I trust ULTA with my hair. The experience was awful and my hair still looks pretty messed. Luckily, roots are growing back.

Carolina's is a local neighborhood spot where those in the know travel to munch on tacos, burritos, tamales, etc. The restaurant isn't much to look at - bars on windows, busy counter where you can look in on tortilla making and the assortment of booths and table/chairs. There is a big line of hungry patrons and people jockeying for tables so that was good news. 

You will find the MOST amazing homemade flour tortillas here! They are chewy, soft and sensuous. This is the stuff dreams are made of. I haven't had a tortilla like this in years and may have to make sure I stop through Phoenix more frequently. Pretty much everything my friends and I tried were awesome. Green corn Tamales, tacos with beef, machaca plate with beans and rice and burrito stuffed with chorizo and potatoes. The beans and rice are perfect - you can't overlook those staples. I think I even noted some lard - perfection! Writing this review is making my mouth water - I could really go for some Carolina's now.

If you're in the neighborhood, an OK place to grab a bite. However, I wouldn't make a special trip. Friendly (but not particularly fast or attentive) staff, and a teeny-tiny parking lot. If you make the trip, I wouldn't order the home fries. Saying that they are under whelming is the nicest way to put it. The prices are comparable to better diners. It's great to have a neighborhood spot, but I just wish when we return it was because it was awesome and not just because it's close.

Senti: A good, but forgettable meal.

A friend had been wanting to try this place and I am always down for something new so was excited to check it out. Most reviews are correct in that the place does feel a bit like a hotel lobby, but to its defense it does feel like a swanky NYC sushi restaurant, which I was totally comfortable with.

The menu looked interesting, but it was the specials that sung to us during our visit. Ordering the Bronzino and the salmon, we also wanted to try a mix side dishes: the bread pudding and fried polenta. We were both pleasantly surprised by both but were quickly distracted with dessert.

The best part of our meal was absolutely the tiramisu. It's honestly the only part I remember because I remember thinking it was the perfect balance of having a coffee flavor with chocolate.

I probably won't go back, except for maybe a glass of wine and more tiramisu!

Oh my chocolate god! Their pastries and chocolate goodies are oh so creamy and delicious. I got an assortment of their truffles  and red velvet cupcake. The truffles will melt in your mouth and it will definitely leave you wanting more. It's about $2.50+ for each truffle and about $7 for the red velvet cupcake, so it is on the pricier end, but you get what you pay for at this place. Drop by for a little taste of heaven if your on the strip.

I stayed in the jubilee tower, and it was absolutely beautiful! I was thrilled that the room didn't reek of cigarette smoke, the bathroom was spotless, the towels were soft, and my room didn't look like some of the unflattering photos I saw on yelp. The floors, however, were questionable.They were pretty sticky, and I stepped on a few hard/crusty spots.  It's definitely nothing a pair of flip flops can't handle, but the tactile memory of crusty/sticky floors is forever engrained in the trauma center of my brain---so I had to take off a star for that. Just make sure to bring a pair of flip flops with you if you plan to stay at Balley's, and this won't be a problem you have to face :)  I also visited Vegas during the hottest time of the year and it just so happened to be 115 degrees outside when I arrived. To say I was extremely excited to cool down at the pool was an under-statement; however, my excitement quickly dissipated when I approached a murky pool that felt more like a jacuzzi. So because it felt hotter to be in the pool than it was to be out of the pool, I had to take away another star.  They did have a few outdoor showers that helped me beat the heat, but don't count on the pool to do the trick. The great thing about this place is that it is centrally located on the strip, and you can easily walk to day clubs and night clubs.

This was a first visit for all six of us. The portions are huge. We ordered two entries and a salad and had more than enough. The chicken Marsala was terrific. The chicken was ver thin, the mushroom gravy was scrumptious. The spaghetti and meatballs was very moist and tasty. The sauce was very thick and flavorful. Everyone was impressed and enjoyed the meal.

Thank you Marshall Shore for letting us know about this place!  We were a party of nine for Easter dinner last night - we filled the diner itself and ordered 1 of everything on the menu [2 of certain items].  There were 10 dinner items and 4 dessert items.  We passed the dishes down the counter to each other.

The menu is strictly vegetarian, but Payton keeps a few meat items available for hard core meaties - like my daughter and I who shared a heavenly fettuccine bolognese.

Each dish was superb.  I have a really hard time deciding on a favorite, but I think I'll go with the Fava and Steuben beans served in agave nectar with a walnut pesto.  My wife and daughter are going with the Beluga lentils, parsley and celery leaf.

We had a tasting menu [no pairing] I would have been happy to pay $75 for and we got away with $20.

Unbelievable.

This place is DEFINITELY NOT CLOSED. I loved it when Sloane Mcfarland was cooking there after getting it back to [almost] original condition and was ecstatic to find out this weekend that it's now a pop up restaurant.

Everyone here is a caring professional. I have never had such painless novocaine injections. 

The dentists, Rosen and Arak, are always upbeat. The only staff member who left in the 11 years I've been coming here retired. 

Everyone who works here loves to come to work. 

For the first time in my life, I don't mind going to the dentist. 

I can't think of anything that is a greater testimony to the quality of this dental practice.

You only know how good a service is when things go wrong. 

I am terrified of using dog groomers to cut those annoying little toenails - walking wounded have staggered out of these places so often I sometimes wonder if I'll be charged with animal abuse as their owner. The opposite is true here. We've got an extremely persnickety faux min pin whose nails could have been done by a pedicurist to the stars! 

And caring? Let me tell ya - I was forced to wait 5 whole minutes to pick up my darling today because a groomer was on the phone with a dog owner, holding a towel-enwrapped shivering little dust mote of a dog maternally to her breast while patiently explaining that the owner's precious freaked out, couldn't be blow-dried and freaked even worse at going into the kennel. So the groomer was ordered to stop all work, charge the owner only for a bath, convince the owner to pick her dog up, and personally hold the dog until the owner arrived. 

I now know just how exemplary this grooming station is. 

I heartily recommend it to every dog owner in this city.

Gelato and I go way back, especially at the Gelato Spot. They got me through some long days of studying for boards and hitting the sweet tooth after an exhausting day at the hospital. But there is a certain charm about the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations (both 5 stars in my opinion) that this specific location lacks. The other Phoenix and Scottsdale locations are in upscale, fun areas that kind of make getting gelato a tasty event....but this location makes me feel like I'm going out to hit up a pawn shop and then donate some used batteries at a Goodwill. 

I initially drove by the plaza they were located in because I looked at it and thought to myself, "Well this area looks dead and dark, there is no way that a Gelato Spot would be in here..." After driving for an additional 3 minutes, I realized I had gone too far and then made the sad realization that they in fact were in the grocery plaza. The Gelato Spot caters to a certain clientele and it looks like they are trying to diversify and attract new customers in this area, but I don't know how successful they will be. When I went in on a Saturday night, they were pretty dead, but I will attribute their lack of customers to a lack of awareness. The ambiance was also super bland, no color, comfort or excitement...nothing like the Scottsdale location. It just seems weird for a place (with the reputation of a Gelato Spot) to open up when things aren't in place. First impressions are everything and my first impression was I should have gone to Frost.

Here's the deal with gelato, my girlfriend and I love Stracciatella, Almond Snickers and Baccio. That's pretty much it and unfortunately this location only had Almond Snickers .......I'm not sure why they wouldn't have some of their more popular flavors on the board for their opening month. We got stuck with trying pistachio and amaretto and we were not fans. The customer service was excellent and I'm sure the flavors I love will eventually get there. I will obviously give this spot another chance in a month or so after they get their act together and will update my review.

Great upbeat atmosphere!

Stack is a great place to pregame/have dinner before a night out in Vegas.  It is open to the casino floor and has a great upbeat/club vibe.  On the weekend nights there is also a DJ in the restaurant.  It's considered casual but the price tag is more upscale. Expect to spend $50 + depending on drinks and appetizers you order.

As far as appetizers go,the rock shrimp are delicious! For show get the hot rocks where you can cook thin slices of sirloin at the top. Pretty tasty too! The ahi tuna tartar is also very tasty.

As far as entrees 2 of my favorites are the sea bass and the Kobe burger.  If you really want to go all out get the filet Oscar style! The lump crab is delicious.

This is a great place to eat for birthday parties, bachelor/bachelorette parties or any big parties where you are celebrating an event and looking to have fun.

Huge portions, tasty food and great prices!

I've eaten here 3 times and everything I tried was delicious!  The first time I got the chicken and waffles (huge and crispy chicken atop yummy waffles), second time I got the French toast which seemed like a good hunk of entire loaf of bread, and the third time I ordered the sundried tomato and goat cheese scramble with crispy potatoes.

I have only come for brunch and can't wait to try the lunch menu.

I'm a big fan of seven Saints. It is hard to find a downtown bar that doesn't annoy the crap out of you or is a place for drunk parents to come visit during the weekend. But this place is a sanctuary for the rest of us who just like to drink whiskey and eat tiny burgers with our friends. I highly suggest the salmon sliders although at $4 a pop they are pretty costly. I pretty much only come on whiskey Wednesdays so I can sample the best that they have. The waiters are always really helpful and will suggest whiskey for you to try even if you're not used to drinking them. Seating can be limited depending on what time you come but if you can grab a table outside during the cooler nights of summer, you'll never find a better place. It is on university so it can be a bit noisy. If you like a squatter place, you might try the piglet or some other bar like Bentleys.

The most exciting part our child had while visiting this exhibition was the train ride there when a train was passing in the opposite direction.

I've not  been to a single science exhibit of this stature in the UK or the US that fails to capture the imagination as this one does. Not only are their typos on their displays,they can't even locate Yellowstone park correctly on their earthquake map for Yogi's sake. 

It's not just the small things the mismatching of the video screens, particularly in the polar section, is really off-putting and maybe they want you to sit in case you get motion sickness and fall over?

It's dull, I don't mean the topic but the whole experience, which is in fairly low light, with loads of text to read to the young ones. Loads of text without a lot of contrast.E.G, The ocean section has sheets that undulate the text back and forward and unless you are right at the bar it's pretty hard to pick up. 

Food is basic and, well it's edible so, let's leave it at that .Here we have yet another ecologically aware science exhibit that sells utter crap in the gift shop for the most part. It would be nice if they could practice the kind of restraint the walls urge the visitors to do. 

It's not all bad the 360 theater is pretty impressive but a really basic movie was showing on the day we went. I.E., what's an astronomer? The movie overstates Galileo a bit and left Copernicus out entirely,that's nice but it's indicative of the cursory geology, astronomy, biology et all within the exhibit that tries to fit too much into a small space and everything suffers from it.  I think kids over 7 will start to get more out of it  but it's light for things to do below that age.

Awful restaurant! This place USED TO BE AWESOME when it was Lolita's. The new-age Mexican food they offered was flavorful and every dish was a culinary experience. Since this place became Coconuts the food has turned to crap. Everything we tried was overcooked, under seasoned and swimming in tasteless sauce.  Tables were sticky and dirty, not tablecloths, and poor service given.  

Do yourself a favor and do not come to eat here. It's a waste of time and money.

This location recently opened and is quickly becoming my favorite wine shop. My girlfriend and I recently stumbled upon this store on Rainbow while driving home and we decided to stop and take a look. Although not as big as other liquor stores in Vegas, this place offers a pretty good selection of wines and spirits at reasonable prices. 

It is worth mentioning the store clerk/manager Steve is an amazing and courteous gentleman. I am a newbie in the wine scene and he has no issues answering all my questions and making some really good recommendations. Since my first visit, Steve has introduced me to Malbec wine from Argentina, Chenin Blanc, and most recently, a Riesling from Oklahoma (I am yet to taste it)... he has even gone above and beyond in trying to get a wine I am looking for and said he'll talk to his district supervisor to try and get it. What a nice guy!

This place is open from 8am to 11:50pm, so if you are in a crunch to get some wine just drop by this place!

So, the last thing you want after getting home from a long day at work is to find your garage door completely BROKEN. The torsion spring had snapped and the garage door was impossible to lift, even with two people trying. It was 6pm and I had no idea who to call or how long it would take to get someone to come down and repair it at a decent price. If there is one thing I have learned living in Vegas is that MOST service companies will try to get every penny they can out of you, specially if the call comes in at night.

I found Mr. Garage Door/United Garage Door on Yelp after calling a couple of other companies, and man am I glad I found them. From beginning to end, this family-owned business delivers an amazing experience and low costs. The lady who answered the phone was very warm and sympathetic to my problem, and did all she could to find the closest technician so my issue was resolved promptly. She was even kind enough to give me a ball park price and a maximum price, that way I would not run into any surprises later on.

The technician, David, showed up about 45 minutes after the call and was thorough in explaining what the problem was. He took the time to inspect the entire garage system to make sure there weren't any other issues and got to work right away. Not only did he give me a complimentary tune up to the rails, drums, etc, but also rectified issues that were created by the original builders of my home. Once the job was completed, David again showed me all he had done and allowed me to test the opening of the garage to make sure everything was to my liking.

Talk about amazing service! Prompt service, no hidden fees, no overtime fees, no 'unexpected' charges and they had all the parts needed in the truck. I would recommend this company with my eyes closed if you ever have a garage issue. 

Thanks David and team!

Here is the review of the car wash that never happened. Interested? Then read on...

Came to this place to get my car washed as it had great reviews. The idea of an indoor car wash place was awesome as I'm feeling under the weather and don't want to stand outside to make sure the job is well done I'm a bit obsessive, yes. 

I arrived and the place looks great. I walked in after parking and was greeted by no one. After standing in the middle of their waiting area (which is really nice and has a full view to the washing/detail area) for a couple of minutes, an employee comes walking in and offered a poor greeting. I asked for a quote on the car and after briefly looking at the car, he muttered $30 and asked me to pull between the stop signs be the entrance of the service area. 

After pulling into the service area, a nice gentleman comes out and shows me their services menu and it turns out they considered my car a mid-sized vehicle. This was news to me since I drive a two-door Hyundai Veloster which is considered a compact car by KBB, Wikipedia and Hyundai!!! As I was getting ready to exit my vehicle with my hands full of misc items (like a drink cup, and a couple of water bottles) I am warned there will be extra charges for bugs on the bumper and debris on the floor carpet. 

Call me crazy, but I believe a CAR WASH business should expect cars to be somewhat dirty when they arrive...That's why customers bring in their cars! Now, I could understand the charges if I was bringing a filthy, pet hair covered vehicle but that was not the case. Remember how I was even hauling out my own soda cup and empty water bottles? Exactly. 

Inflated prices along with extra fees to do the basics of the job, made me change my mind pretty quickly. I left right away and, odds are, I won't come back. I refuse to pay $40+tip  for the wash of a compact car. 

I will say, they facilities we pretty cool.

The custard is kind of like soft serve ice cream but creamier (or more eggy, but in a good way).
The staff was very friendly, and the Italian ice is really tasty with loads of revolving fun flavors.

I came here twice in my week visit to Vegas and would for sure come again!

Pizza is ubiquitous in America. Strike up a conversation with any of your friends, and you will hear them rattle off names, which I can only guess has something to do with being in a capitalist society with brave entrepreneurs competing for a slice of that pizza demand curve amongst a glut of supply. Its not easy to decide when there are so many choices. 

However, thats why I'm here people. :) I'm going to point you at the lighthouse through all these storm clouds, and that place is in Ahwatukee, and it is called "JIMMY & JOE'S PIZZERIA". 

Allow me to explain. This place is different than the others. Its not just the fact that the decor and quality of design inside makes for a visually impressive and comfortable experience. Their menu is UNIQUE. Upon my first experience, I came under the pressure of some of my coworkers that dragged me along against my will. Reason being, I was trying to drop a few pounds, and I was averse to stuffing my face with the appetite kryptonite that pizza is to my Regularman. What I found, though, was that I could order a freshly made slice, instead of a personal size or some other portion destined to tempt me to overeat. Simple concept it would seem right? Well, maybe not, because their aren't many places where you can get a slice that is made at JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. There were also combo options, with the drink included, and ways to add a salad and select the toppings you want. Its kinda like Chipotle took off its clothes and became a pizza joint. A compliment I intentionally invoke because of their similarities; and these things are the cleanliness, quality, and ability to customize your order. Well done JIMMY. Well done.

I haven't had their delivery yet, but I do know that they do offer that. Since its my opinion I'm sharing, with the intent that it will persuade you also, I would recommend coming here to eat with friends. Its affordable, spacious, and you can even move the tables around if you have a big group with you. 

I will conclude with the BEST thing I like, next to their thin New York style slices, and it is this: 

REWARDS!

If you sign up for their loyalty program, you are rewarded with special offers via text, such as free slices and discounts, which I have thankfully benefited from when money has been scarce. More importantly though, you get the feeling that your business isn't being taken for granted. I like this particularly, and I will continue to rewind my visits, rather than fast forward. :)

So many great sandwiches to choose from, I almost lost count. There's gotta be at least 30. The quality is very consistent. I ordered the "Castle Gandolfo" today. It comes with turkey, pastrami, marinated mushrooms, swiss, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar. Try ordering that at Subway. :) lol

I definitely recommend this place if you are in the Ahwatukee/Tempe area. Fresh quality ingredients, friendly service, and great tasting food. Here, you get what you pay for.

Pizza is ubiquitous in America. Strike up a conversation with any of your friends, and you will hear them rattle off names, which I can only guess has something to do with being in a capitalist society with brave entrepreneurs competing for a slice of that pizza demand curve amongst a glut of supply. Its not easy to decide when there are so many choices. 

However, thats why I'm here people. :) I'm going to point you at the lighthouse through all these storm clouds, and that place is in Ahwatukee, and it is called "JIMMY & JOE'S PIZZERIA". 

Allow me to explain. This place is different than the others. Its not just the fact that the decor and quality of design inside makes for a visually impressive and comfortable experience. Their menu is UNIQUE. Upon my first experience, I came under the pressure of some of my coworkers that dragged me along against my will.

The Minit is a lot of fun if you are out with your friends and just feel like drinking and having a good time. Its not a great place to meet people and dont expect people to be very friendly. lol. Good thing is there are a lot of beautiful women walking around, the place has a very cool look, and the outside bar is nice too. Very well designed and as far as a nightclub, this is probably the best in the area.

My most familiar place for seafood in the valley. (I am still expanding my base). I have enjoyed each visit to the Fish Market. I enjoy the casual atmosphere and the friendly accommodating service. The sushi is basic but fresh as is the selection of sashimi. The fresh oysters are the best, and I can never pass up an oyster shooter, lol. You can make a meal out of their Baked Oysters Rockefeller which are one of my favorite items on the menu.  The cioppino is great but you must have patience and napkins to work the crab and shellfish out of their shells.  Their linguini with clams and any sauce is the best (again patience and napkins for removing clams from their shells).  Their chowders and smoked fish options are great.  I also enjoy watching as they prepare any item that is being grilled over mesqite coals.  I have yet to be dissapointed, whether seated in the dining room or choosing to eat at the bar.

I have been CRAVING Indian food lately and after hearing about FOI from a coworker and reading the reviews here, I decided to try it out for lunch. Ok it is a buffet, I knew that, but I have been to some very good Indian buffets. When I walk into any ethnic restaurant and I see people of the same ethnicity of the restaurant eating there I get excited. It must be good right?   This table must have been family and eat for free because I have had better. The naan was just ok, the Tandoori chicken, meh (well I have never been a big fan of this anyway because almost anywhere it is usually just dry bland chicken to me). The butter chicken type dish with tomatoes, was ok but looked like they added red food coloring. I enjoyed the flavor of the meatball dish, the palak dish was bland. Honestly the only other dish I found interesting other than the meatballs was the Carrot "pudding" which was sauteed sweet minced carrots, went back twice just for that. The sweet rice was ok, it had raisins and coconut.  I generally prefer it without either.
 I may go try it one more time and order off the menu for dinner. Give it a fair chance before completely ruling it out.

I filmed my music video to a song called ICE CREAM ROAD here.  This place will always be a place that's important to me in Pittsburgh.  Beyond that, it's just a awesome family owned Ice Cream Parlor.

If there's a type of ice cream or sundae or frozen dairy concoction you love they got it.  From blend ins to banana splits and hot fudge sundaes and flavored soft serve.  Speaking of, you can combine flavors which I just learned of and blended peanut butter and banana, it tasted exactly how I had hoped.

This place gets ridiculously busy on a hot day so be ready to stand in line for a half hour if its one of those days.  While you stand in line copy and paste the info below into YouTube

This place is awesome in so many ways.  I've been here during a biking session to refuel, to casually drink and to bring a friend for a burger and all 3 times have been consistent.

I ate the Dirty Rag (a burger with pickle and peanut butter) from their large varieties of burgers and its the fuel you need to recover or to start going.  This place makes me want peanut butter on all my burgers.  The fries have that crispy potato dust flavor you don't find many places that make them extra good and the drink selection is always fresh with lots of specials.

The environment is very unique and friendly and the bartenders are always on top of things.  I would highly recommend visiting this place and getting bacon wrapped bananas on a burger.  Trust me, it's worth it.

What I Ate
Combo (Hangar 1)

What is it?
A pound of boneless wings with fries and a drink

Price
$16.57

Flavor I got
Teriyaki and Golden Barbecue

Bonus
I upgraded my fries to Ranch Waffle Fries


Verdict
This was essentially a chicken tender/curly fry combo BUT, the greatest chicken tender/curly fry combo I think I've had my whole life up to this point.

The first thing that really struck me as awesome is how it wasn't greasy!  The fries and chicken was fried to perfection.  The chicken is perfectly white meat, how they should be.  Usually I'm grossed out by big portions but this didn't make me feel like that.

This was enough food for 2 people and worth the money.  I would definitely come back here.  When it comes to chicken and fries this place should be in your bookmarks.

I could go on and on about this place, but all I need to say is this is the kind of experience you want when you come to Vegas. 5 star rooms, friendly staff, amazing amenities, great restaurants, and experienced/friendly dealers (if you gamble). They have always taken care of me for the past few years and have made me a loyal patron after bouncing around other properties on the strip for prior stays. They also take care of their rated players (speaking from experience).

I guess you could call it a more sofisticated experience. There is no buffet (thank God), and the property seems to not appeal that much to the short-wearing, beer-gutted slobs that you see all to often elsewhere on the strip. I'm not saying you won't see them here, but there is definitely an air of relative class at Venetian that is lacking in most other proprties on the strip.

And for those new to the strip, the Venetian is located on the end of the strip that you want to be on. Close to all of the shops, restaurants, and casinos worth going to. All within walking distance. You won't need luck in having a great vacationing experience when you go here. A sure bet.

If there is any place in Vegas that we wear out it's Bouchon. The breakfast experience here is the best (as long as there isn't a wait). A French brasserie, Bouchon is an ornate high-ceiling restaurant that brings the feeling of an old cafe in Paris to the strip.

The breakfast menu is simple, but good. Probably the best oatmeal I've ever had. Like other reviews, it's just a good place to start off the day; especially if it's nice enough to sit outside in the courtyard. The pommes frites are a must. Fancy name, but really good fries. And yes...the fries work in the morning fare.

Warning to vegetarians. While I've never had a problem with finding things I like to eat here, they do like to include bacon with and in lots of dishes so watch out. The potato croquettes have bacon in them. Sorry piggies...I didn't know until I swallowed a bite.

I have this review here - but  will copy this to their actual name Jekyll & Hyde

I like themed pubs and I am very pleased a sinister themed pub like this is in Edinburgh. Though I am struggling to give this place 4 stars.
They have loads of room up  in the back and down the stairs - it is like a vault or mad scientist laboratory - which is the theme..duh. They have torches outside above the door and a library on the indoor veranda. There is no corner or table that is the same. 
They play rock music and not your usual background muzak. For me it is a little loud and does overtake the conversation. But on being an interesting pub stakes it gets a star. Another star is the toilet. - if you can find it.  When I take new people to this place I always let them try to figure it out - most hilarious..ah well - easily pleased et al. 
The beers and wine and spirits are all your usuals and they serve up themed cocktails - which sometimes are serves in testubes and a full rack is available - nice touch. Not too expensive.

I've been here on birthday parties,  just a group of friends and on HALLOWEEN (!) - yup that last one was a nice night out . 

Just a word of warning - it is busy from Wednesday to Sunday - so take that in mind.

The Scotsman Hotel is a great venue for many occasions, this occasion was a afternoon tea with some Yelpers in one of the function rooms. It was a nice big banquet table set up and we were brought to the room by one of the bartenders. We were then handed to the very capable hands of a function manager - she took our coats and  sat us down.  

we were sat on a table with full linen and (porcelain?) crockery. Our water glasses were promptly filled. Once we all sat down she placed the napkin and took our tea orders. They had a full complement of loose teas. 
I went for the famous Scotsman breakfast and an additional Jasmine green tea. These are served in full sized classic teapots and strainers. 

She also fully explained the delight that were served to us - after ensuring that there were any dietary requirements. 
Scones, clotted cream, sliders, bon bons, profiteroles, soldier cut crust-less sandwiches with salmon cucumber, egg, ham, cheese and also some flap jacks and carrot cakes. 

The acoustics of the room allowed for a conversation to be followed from all over the table without getting too loud., although the level of conversation topics was at times a bit questionable, but that cannot be attributed to the Scotsman :o)

I had a wonderful time and relay enjoyed the visit. This is something i would be proud to take my mum to when she visits Edinburgh!

Stop-Over bar. I cannot see myself a whole night in this pub. It is conveniently located and easy to get to and to find if your are not know with Edinburgh. 
I have used it for that reason only so far. Enter - get beer - meet friend(s) - get another beer - maybe a snack  - then go where we wanted to go all along.
Don't get me wrong  - the place is pleasant enough to be, beautiful ceiling and very friendly staff, just not where I like to spend an whole evening. 
In the summer I did spend a bit more time sitting on their terras - people watching and sunbathing (if the weather allows it) - Not my favourite but I have certainly no problems meeting up in this place.

This is a really good Syrian restaurant! But I need to make something very clear. There are two sides to this place, Alep & Petit Alep. Alep is for your Syrian grandfather, Petit Alep is more modern, trendy. But... You can, and should ask for the Alep menu which is larger and more complete. I usually order the tasting menu and it's always great. You get to try about 10 different things in a few services.

They also have a fantastic wine list with a huge collection of private imports. Also, plenty of bio wine which is nice to try. Same taste, less sulfites, less hangover;)

Best souvlaki in the montreal area. Don't let the amateurs tell you differently.

I was staying on a work visit at Excalibur and decided to try out the buffet as I thought it'd be quicker than trying to sit down at one of the other restaurants.

I was quickly mistaken as it seems the buffet line couldn't seem to be executed quickly.

I waited for a good 45mins before I was even seated. They offered a unlimited "eat all day" option for a higher price and when those people came back for their meal; they were told they had to return to the end of the line like everyone else.

Once I got seated & tried to get into line to get food; it wasn't very well organized and the food was sub-par. Not a huge selection & they had steamed shrimp but no butter. Asked the chef if they had melted butter & was told they had butter for bread & that was all.

Overall, you'll get what you pay for. It was not the best meal I've had.

I had never heard of this restaurant before and was introduced by some business associates. 

We came for lunch with a party of 8. We were seated in the back patio in a semi-private area. 

Our server was great and we had a good meal. Most of the girls had the salads (all gigantic sized) and most of the men had sandwiches and things of that nature.

They had lemonade which I had and it was just okay. I had asked if they could flavor it and was looked at like I had asked if they could add alcohol to it. Usually in Seattle, you can get a strawberry lemonade, etc so I didn't think my request was too strange but apparently it is in AZ. 

The atmosphere was nice and I can see it being a good spot for happy hour. The interior bar area definitely had a hip feel to it.

Having been a member of a national chain gym in the past, I was a bit skeptical about joining Golds and dealing with the hassle of contracts and parking and busy machines. Not so here, I'll say: I love going to this gym! 

1. No annual contract: that was the biggest pain dealing with during my last membership at a different gym, I don't know if I'm going to be living somewhere for however many years and canceling is a PAIN IN THE ya know! They have good deals at Golds, for me it was 19.95$/mo for access to all classes and gyms nationwide and only a $40 yearly maintenance fee - I can deal with that. No hidden fees crap! AND I get to bring a friend free every time I go to the gym, I have taken advantage of this option almost every time, and it's really great! 2 for 1 and workout with a friend! My friend likes it so much, he's getting his own membership!

2. Cardio cinema - what else is there to say, this is so cool and such a fun easy way to get cardio in!!  I wish it were open past 10 pm and it is annoying to have to stop my workout to ask them to reset the movie, but I'm being picky now...

3. Good classes, I've done body combat, yoga, yoga bootcamp (Rasa is awesome, I wish this class was offered more!!), Zumba, body pump and some others, they are all great! Seems to be a good community where teachers recognize you and they have fun Halloween and party kickoff classes. Variety of options and times and if I want more, there's always the Eastern location...

4. They do a good job of maintaining the place.  I've been a member since August 2012 and since then, they have replaced the padding on some machines and also fixed one of the TVs that had been out. I have not tried the showers or sauna, but the locker rooms have always been clean, and same goes for the rest of the gym. There's plenty of parking and even on peak times, like 6 pm on weekdays, there's usually not much wait for a weight machine and I've always been able to find an elliptical in the cinema room. It never feels really busy, which is great!

Having been a member of a national chain gym in the past, I was a bit skeptical about joining Golds and dealing with the hassle of contracts and parking and busy machines. Not so here, I'll say: I love going to this gym! 

1. No annual contract: that was the biggest pain dealing with during my last membership at a different gym, I don't know if I'm going to be living somewhere for however many years and canceling is a PAIN IN THE ya know! They have good deals at Golds, for me it was 19.95$/mo for access to all classes and gyms nationwide and only a $40 yearly maintenance fee - I can deal with that. No hidden fees crap! AND I get to bring a friend free every time I go to the gym, I have taken advantage of this option almost every time, and it's really great! 2 for 1 and workout with a friend! My friend likes it so much, he's getting his own membership!

2. Cardio cinema - what else is there to say, this is so cool and such a fun easy way to get cardio in!!  I wish it were open past 10 pm and it is annoying to have to stop my workout to ask them to reset the movie, but I'm being picky now...

3. Good classes, I've done body combat, yoga, yoga bootcamp (Rasa is awesome, I wish this class was offered more!!), Zumba, body pump and some others, they are all great! Seems to be a good community where teachers recognize you and they have fun Halloween and party kickoff classes. Variety of options and times and if I want more, there's always the Eastern location...

4. They do a good job of maintaining the place.  I've been a member since August 2012 and since then, they have replaced the padding on some machines and also fixed one of the TVs that had been out. I have not tried the showers or sauna, but the locker rooms have always been clean, and same goes for the rest of the gym. There's plenty of parking and even on peak times, like 6 pm on weekdays, there's usually not much wait for a weight machine and I've always been able to find an elliptical in the cinema room. It never feels really busy, which is great!

I'm a big fan of this gym, I will be a member here for the long term!

I like this particular Store because they have a bigger food selection than most. They're still short on produce, so if you need fruit and veggies you're better off going to a Sprouts.

I am definitely a fan of this place! The layout alone makes it worth it. They have a huge outdoor patio which is lovely most of the year. The inside is great too, they have a bar that is perfect for happy hour, and a market as well with coffee, pastries, other drinks, and various sorbets if you want something light or something to go.

Don't be afraid to dive into the bread they bring at the beginning of the meal; the pesto is fabulous! I'm a huge fan of the Mediterranean salad, which I get with salmon. I have a lot of business lunch meetings here, but day or night this is a great place to work or play!

I feel like I have given this place so many chances and they just continually fail to impress. I've been here twice for brunch and their food is mediocre. The presentation is good and it always looks like it should taste better than it does. 

I went today for lunch and ordered the quinoa and goat cheese salad with chicken. The chicken was really over cooked and dry. The lettuce was limp, I believe due to how much dressing was on it, however it was hard to tell because he dressing had almost no flavor to it. One thing that was actually pretty great was the goat cheese. It's a medallion that is encrusted with almonds, fried (I think) and drizzled with a balsamic vinegar glaze. Fabulous! 

Long story short, I won't ever go here again unless I have to. There are just too many restaurants on this block to be stuck with sub-par food.

I just signed up a week ago- post-renovations and I must say it is a very nice, clean, gym with great group classes.  So far I've taken spinning, pilates, and zumba and all the instructors have been energetic and great!  The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the personal training manager Dylan is an irresponsible, douche bag, who can't be bothered to confirm appointments or return phone calls.    So if you're not interested in personal training and like taking fun classes I would recommend this gym.

This foodie thinks it's well worth the drive from North Scottsdale to Downtown Chandler for a refreshing paletas.  All their flavors are unique but my favorites would have to be the Key Lime Pie, Mexican Hot Chocolate and Strawberry Cream.  My dog was also in frozen treat heaven, he ate the chicken flavored puppy paleta so fast I was afraid he'd get brain freeze!  A local business definitely worth checking out!

I can pretty much sum this place up in one word.......mmmmmm.

Ok, not really a word, and, of course, I can't really leave a review at one noise, but seriously....mmmmm. I could eat this food all the time...except then I would be super fat, so I won't, but the point is that I could!

I went here on Monday night for my sister in law's birthday/anniversary party. We had a large group of at least ten people. Our waiter, Rodger, was great! He was very attentive, kept our waters full, and even remembered everyone's order correctly without writing it down...pretty impressive stuff. 

I ordered the steak frites, but because we were such a large group, I got to try a bunch of menu items. We started with the fondue (soooo good....I wanted to eat it straight with a fork), the loaded chips (?), also very tasty, and the mini corndogs, good, but not as good as the other two. My steak was delicious, it had an herb butter on top and was cooked perfectly. The fries were crispy and perfect. The BF got the burger with church potatoes. The burger was a pretty standard burger....not something I would come here for specifically, but the church potatoes were pretty good. I tried someone else's ribs.....EXCELLENT! The bbq sauce was spicy and sweet...the meat fell off the bone...this is something I would definitely recommend. I think our table had (possibly) one of each entree and everyone raved about the food. I would definitely come back here again.

I have been here a few times since my previous review for both dinner and breakfast. I will say, I am always satisfied, even though the BF doesn't always love it. When I went for breakfast, I had the matador which was delicious potatoes with chile verde and eggs on a crispy tortilla...it was pretty fantastic. Also, I have had their delicious multi grain salad and their really tasty chicken and corn chowder. Anyway, this place continues to be a satisfying place to eat...no, it's not the best food in town....but I never leave feeling sad that I came.

This shop screams cute..... cute cute cute. It's like a bakery on a movie set, I kid you not. I walked by the shop after lunch and, despite being totally full, I just couldn't not go in... the vintage -y decor and neatly displayed pastries called out to me.... I was doomed. The people who work here are very nice, helpful, and friendly. Their recipes are mostly Italian based, which makes them a little different than other local bakeries. After much deliberation (and I mean MUCH.... like extensive), I tried the brownie and the cheesecake. The brownie looked kind of dry on the outside, but don't let that fool you, it was somewhere between a cake texture and a fudgy brownie texture, certainly not dry. The brownie was chocolatey but not overly rich with chocolate chips throughout. Was it my favorite brownie in town? No (I am partial to a fudgy more chocolatey and rich brownie). But it was very good and if I were in the neighborhood I would get it again. The cheesecake, on the other hand, was fairly awesome. This was no New York cheesecake. It was surprisingly light and airy, not the heavy oh-my-god-I'm-so-full-need-bigger-pants kind of cheesecake you get most places (not that I don't like that too, this was just something you may want to eat with more frequency). It was sweet without being overly sweet and they didn't complicate it with toppings or flavors, it was just a good plain cheesecake. Oh, and it isn't served in slices, it's served like a cupcake.... so cute. Anyway, each dessert cost 3$, so the prices are competitive with other local bakeries. Definitely check this cute little bakery out next time you're in the area.


PS they have cupcakes and the flavors change depending on the baker's mood each day.... how cute is that? 

PPS Can I say cute one more time? Whoa.

Ugh. We came in for dinner on New Years (1/1) and seated ourselves in the bar area. 

Yes it's busy. I mean holiday in Vegas? Drink like. The hubs and I swung by Vegas just to see what the type is all about. 

My fave Maggiano location is South Coast in Newport. It clean, food is favorful, great texture, and well attentive and high class staff.

This Vegas location. We were highly disappointed. I ordered the frutti de mare. Fancy sh!t right? Man, my entree was salllttttyyyyy. My blood pressure and sodium level just increased - nurse dilute me! My husband got the lasagna and we shared he appetizer of calamari. It tasted reheated or microwaved. 

Our drinks were the best of the night - a coke and a glass of wine. Prepared directly by the company. No chefs needed. 

$70 wears our tab and I shake my head to this restaurant. We should stick to our all time fave homey mainstream Italian - Buca di Bepo instead!

I will DEFINITELY come here again!! Solidly-unpretentious-yet-pleasant atmo, excellent Greek/Mediterranean food, and super-reasonable prices. 

Everything is made fresh onsite by awesomely surly Greek studs who mutter "OPA!" with phoned-in enthusiasm whenever someone puts a tip in the jar. But I don't care how surly those motherfuckers are -- they make some BOMB-ASS food!

On my first visit, I had saganaki (a/k/a flaming fried cheese), lentil soup (!!!) and a pomegranate chicken wrap. Everything was EXCELLENT! My friend also had soup and a gyro platter, and the total was around $45. I came back another time and had chicken kabobs or something...don't remember exactly what, but I do remember it being DELICIOUS and amazing!

I did not experience the poor service here others have talked about...but then, the place was totally deserted when I came in at 6pm on a Saturday.

I did not smoke hookah (that shit is TERRIBLE for you), but I had dinner. My friend and I shared a salad and the mezze platter, which was huge and DELICIOUS! The food was really truly excellent, from start to finish.

The reason I'm only giving 4 instead of 5 stars is, it was a little on the expensive side. $42 for mezze for 2...eh, idk, I think Paymon's is a better value. And the atmo at Paymon's is better.

But if you find yourself craving Mediterranean food, and you're not near a Paymon's.... this place will do just fine!

The quality of food at this establishment is nothing compared to how it was two years ago. 

Honestly im probably only coming to this place in the future if the buffet at Caesars is too packed (3hr wait). 

No lines here either. $50 a person or approximately that price.

While claiming to "love locals" from every local television outlet, we were bemused by staff comments on service at Guadalajara, the Mexican bar & grill off the casino.  With a little less than an hour to show time, we considered a quick drink and snack at the bar, followed by a casual stroll to the show room.  20 minutes after sitting at a bar table, making repeated eye contact with the wait staff, we remained ignored.  Polite initiative resulted in chips & salsa, over-sweetened  lemonade and a margarita made from an off-the-shelf mix.  Table-side guacamole 'served with warm tortillas' was served with the same chips provided with the salsa.  We heard lame excuses about a power outage, being "very busy" and no through-put in the kitchen.  No back-up generators in a casino?  Really?  The surly waitress might have had a bad night, but that's no excuse for being rude.  The manager was apologetic and made compensatory overtures which were appreciated.  How difficult is it to get service right from the onset when a guest enters the dining or drinking area?  After all, it's Las Vegas!

But what about "We Love Locals!"?  Why is management so blind to the quality level of service in such a competitive environment?  Is the economy so dreadful that staff is hired without appropriate training in "hope" that "things will work out"?  While Guadalajara at Boulder Station stands as an example, it's not the only venue suffering from arrogant service staff, ill equipped from a lack of training or the business values imbued from a successful and attractive destination.  Re-directing investments from TV advertising to staff training and business execution will result in more demand from word of mouth and repeat customers happy with their experience.

Gaetano Palmeri is a bona fide professional.  Having dined at his place in Calabasas, CA years ago, he's not skipped a beat.  The menu will satisfy just about anyone seeking an Italian meal with a great range of starters, a variety of pastas, great seafood and meat selections.  We're fond of the warm cabbage salad, but tonight we opted for the special arugula with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette split.  My wife devoured the barramudi with chopped tomato and I coasted along with a risotto with chicken and asparagus.  Perfect mid-week meal.

The dining room is so comfortable in a refined way.  Murals and mirrors on the walls with soft but adequate lighting goes beyond inviting.  A full bar can start or end the meal and I'm told the desserts are special.  Can't say enough good things about Gaetano's.  We're not missing a repeat visit any time soon.

I hesitated between giving 3 stars or 4 stars for this hotel. It's a beautiful hotel. It's large, in a great location and I love that there's a nice fitness facility on site. The rooms are spacious, the beds are very comfortable and our room had a great view of the river and downtown Pittsburgh. 
Initially, our impressions of the staff were positive. Friendly, smiling, eye contact - all good. Check in was a breeze. The first problem arose when I got to my room and pulled up my credit card transactions on my phone. The hotel had charged $50 to my card WITHOUT my authorization. I'm aware that hotels take your cc info at check in for "incidentals" (phone calls, drinking the $10 bottles of water, room damages) but I've never had a hotel charge me IN ADVANCE for incidentals. The main problem that I had, however, was not the charge (because I know it's refunded if I don't have any incidentals) it's the fact that they did not inform me of this charge at check in. I went back to the Front desk to speak to the manager. I expressed my frustration. The thing that really irritates me with management at any establishment is when they think that they are resolving your issue by simply repeating their policy to you over and over again. They sound like robots mechanically repeating the policy over and over again as if that is going to make me understand why they did it. The management did not take any responsibility for not informing me of this policy up front. The second issue I have with this hotel is their ridiculous parking fees. They charge you $23 per day to park there. Really? I'm hotel guest. Yes, I knew about this but it still is annoying to have to pay this outrageous amount. I had booked this hotel using Hotwire. I got a great deal ,however Hotwire did not reveal to me before I had finalized the deal that the parking would be $23 per day. I guess that is one of the drawbacks of using hotwire you do not know the name of the hotel until you have paid and you also do not know about any other fees that you may have to pay. Other then the issue I had about the unauthorized $50 charge to my credit card, the hotel was a nice place to stay. It was quiet on my floor and the beds were very comfortable. I also really enjoyed and used the fitness center and they also have an indoor pool. There is a restaurant on site however we didn't eat there because we already knew that the prices would be crazy. There is a Starbucks in the lobby as well but we didn't use it either. Without the Hotwire deal that I got this hotel runs from about $200 to way over $400 per night to stay there. I got a great deal for $89 per night. I would stay there again but only if I could get another great deal like that. I do not think it is worth $200 per night to stay there.

There is a Starbucks in the lobby as well but we didn't use it either. Without the Hotwire deal that I got this hotel runs from about $200 to way over $400 per night to stay there. I got a great deal for $89 per night. I would stay there again but only if I could get another great deal like that. I do not think it is worth $200 per night to stay there. However, the location is great.

Great ambience,  the waiter was super friendly Alexandro. I had the tuna burger and poutine. The burger was good. I was not expecting it to be cold but it was delicious. The poutine was better than the average . I prefer the BBQ sauce than the standard poutine. Sweet potato fries  are addictively yummy .  And the owner is super friendly and free desserts

Tried this place by recommendation.   For being right on the square, prices were great also.  I had the The Old Fashioned House Burger and wife had the Friday special (Beer-battered cod).  I can say I was not disappointed.   Food was awesome !!!   And lets not forget the drinks....Their Old Fashion drinks are out of this world.

Service was great also.  Staff puts an effort to make sure everything is per the customer's desires.

The food is so freaking good and they even have take out online for when you don't want to talk to another person. The restaurant staff are friendly and personable . Super chill vibe but it had a ton of famjams going on when I went in.  The restaurant does not feel like you are in the bar even though they are attached. I will eat here again!

I tried this gym for the first time and I loved it. They do totally push you until you want to barf but if you want a great workout I would definitely recommend this place. You wear a heart rate monitor and it tells you how you are doing by the second on a big screen. The amount of time you're supposed to be in each zone is a little confusing but the trainers are always willing to discuss your results at the end. Some trainers are better than others but I've only had two and I enjoyed class with both of them.

Devon pushed me to have almost 10 minutes in the orange zone. I think the zones are a bit higher than they need to be sometimes and it gets harder and harder to hit those zones the more fit you get/the more you go.

Remember that the zones are based on an average person's heart and if you have a better or worse heart, your results will reflect that. 

The treadmill doesn't even get me to orange anymore and I feel like I'm not doing well but my fitness is improving each time.

I found out about Polished from some girls I worked with who always had phenomenal nails. I made an appointment to get a full set and I never looked back. 
I'm not sure who did my nails the first couple times but I was put with Bobby on my third appointment because I wanted someone really good at shaping. I always get my nails done in stilleto points, one time I needed a nail repair (free) the woman I was with did not shape my nail well at all. 
I love Bobby though. He doesn't talk (which I love, I can't stand small talk), he's polite, he's fast, and he's phenomenal at shaping. I will never book with anyone else again unless it's an emergency. 
The environment of the salon is clean, it's cute, but modern. They play top 40's music and club music which is obnoxious but I just bring my head phones. 
A fill for acrylics and regular polish is only $20, and since I get my nails done every two weeks my polish never chips or gets discolored. They have a HUGE nail polish color selection, and a lot of nail techs. 
The only down side of this salon is its really busy and sometimes booking over the phone can take awhile, other than that I've never had a problem.

Where to begin. I've gone to the Arizona Mills theatres a few times now. The prior times have always been a good experience. That changed last night. 

Last night I went out on a date night with my wife. The theatre itself is fine. The screen is big, there is stadium seating and is reasonably clean for as many people seeing a show. 

The place was busy when we saw the show at 7:15 and was packed when we exited the movies 2 hours later. As I left the movie, the concession stand was about 10 deep in about 6-8 lines. 

This is what I had to deal with last night:
-A crying baby at a rated R movie. The crying was throughout the movie and the parent was alone. I think the baby must have been upset with the violence and nudity on screen. WHY do this to a baby and the other patrons?
-people consistently checking their phone to check a text/voice mail
-People talking to the screen or chatting with their neighbor
-A mother allowing her young child to treat the stairs like a personal jungle gym during the movie. The child was up towards the top and would run up and down. Again, why bring a baby or young children to a rated R movie? Hire a babysitter and have a few hours alone! 

I think the next time I check a movie out here, I'll stick to mid afternoon or stick to Tempe Marketplace..

capnophobia 1. An intense hatred, or fear, of smoking or having anyone around who is polluting the air in the immediate vicinity with tobacco smoke;

Do not come here if you have capnophobia!

Do come here if you want to smoke in an airport. No food, just booze and a place to light up. Every airport should have one of these f@ckers. Lot's of smoke. Party like a rock star, smell like an ashtray. No cigars allowed, which sucks, since they sell them 50' away.

I have come to the conclusion that there are no Filipino vegetarians. They do have vegetable dishes here, but all made with fish or meat stocks. Located in the Hawaiian Village Kapit Bahay offers authentic Filipino cuisine. The shop itself is warm and inviting, the food is fresh and kept well. The woman at the counter offered many samples to my friends. Reviews from the others were that the Pork Adobo and Chicken Curry dishes were good. My Filipino friend thought the Halo Halo was good as well. Prices were very reasonable for fresh, authentic food right on the strip. So while there was no vegetarian options, I do like saying Halo Halo.

Chipotle!!!! I love you but your empoyees are idiots. I asked them if the oil in the rice was hydrogenated and they told me YES

So after avoiding them for a good 3 months I decided to go inside and ask to see the oil.

It is Non Hydrogenated soybean oil, yes it had a few preservatives but no TRANS FATTY OILS!!!!!

The Tortilla however does have trans fat :( 

But Ive been making up for old times, I think Ive had the Veggie bowl like 3 times this week!!!

Im outta control, but Ill eat good starting tomorrow ?

I wrote an email to the director of quality control. I have pasted the conversation for you all!

 
Hey,I love your gelato and I eat there once a week. It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site. 
I also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.

 

 


Lindsay,

 

Thanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.  Thanks for hitting the gelato spot.

I cant believe I ever went here, but my girlfriend did the models hair that were doing a fashion show for the ugliest homemade garbage. So I came for support. 

Anyway, every dude in there looks the same. Low rise seven jeans with a sparkley belt with shirt tucked behind the questionably femenine buckle, sunglasses inside, orange tan, waxed eyebrows, and shaved arms.
I spoted the  lone creepy old dude that was obviously on raver drugs, in the middle of the dance floor raving out. 
Bros and sluts were all freek dancing and being douchy and slutty.
A ton of younger chicks with older dudes.

Its one of those places were dumb sluts starved for attention come and make out with each other in front of the ed hardy faux buff guys. 

(faux buff= fat that looks like muscle under a shirt)

Whats up with all the faux buff dudes in Scottsdale. You know what Im talking about.


I dont know why they would ever charge ten dollars to come here.

This is for the club by Gate A17. Smallest club I've ever been in but still better than sitting out in the terminal. Friendly staff, nice snacks (trail mix, chips, crackers and fruit). I would have been disappointed if I had paid for admission but coming in for free with a guest using the American Express platinum card made it worthwhile. Not sure this lounge is worth going out of your way to get to but it was nice having it two doors down from our gate.

YUM!!  I'm a big fan of Hopdoddy and I can't wait to go back many many more times.  This was my 2nd visit and it did not disappoint.  Here are the highlights...

- Ambiance is cool, modern and low key.  High top tables and outdoor seating are a plus

- Experience is casual but can be annoying since you stand in line to order and then they bring it to your table 20 minutes later.

- Happy Hour - go after 9pm for great deals!  Or before 6pm if your schedule permits

- Food - Ahi Tuna burger is delicious!  You can't go wrong with any of the options.  You can get any meat on any of the burgers so there are a ton of options.  If you like spicy - then go for the ones with poblano peppers!

This was the first place we went to once we got to Vegas, our 9 pm dinner reservation meant we were starving.

Our table wasn't ready when we got there so we opted to get some cocktails, we were just going to go to the bar and get drinks (that's what we do in New Orleans), but a cocktail waitress took our order.it took 30 minutes for her to take our order, deliver the drinks, deliver the bills, and to never pick up the receipts. The hostess didn't want to sit us until our bills were picked up, but it was already 930 and they were threatening to give up our reservation. 

We ended up walking over to our table with your drinks and checks in hand.

The bread and sauce appetizer that is given to the table was delicious (first is free, second was round is charged.)

I opted for the chicken parmigiana with a side of pasta (the portion is so big you do not need the pasta).

The chicken was thinly pounded and THE SIZE OF MY FACE! Seriously, iced never seen such a large chicken! I was able to eat about half (my cousin ate the second half later) and took a few bites from my cousins meatballs and spaghetti and Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious and the portions were huge - I wish we would have tried the meatball.

WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. EVEN WORST WAXING.

So I came here to wax my legs. The receptionist on the phone told me that price for full legs was 15$. So that is the only reason why I came here. I went inside, and there was a french girl in the reception. She was also the aesthetician. They had this terrible elevator music playing all the time and she was literally singing it the whole time. Pretty annoying. She gave me these papers to fill in and when I finished and I went back to giving them back to her she was not there. She was the only person working in the whole place. I had to wait for approximately 15 minutes for her to come back. Then we went into the room and started waxing my legs, singing the WHOLE TIME. It was really getting on my nervs. Then she made a couple of comments about my legs that I found pretty offensive, but I didn't say anything because I figured english was not her first language and probably she meant something else. She took literally 45 minutes to wax my legs, and then she told me that the price was 30$. I told her that the girl on the phone told me it was 15$. I also told her to wax my upper lip (which the girl on the pgone said it was 10$) and she said it was 12$. They are extremely unorganized and don't know shit about their services. But the worst part came here, when I asked her if she could wax the hair in between my eyebrows and she put the biggest amount of wax i have ever seen and waxed half of my left eyebrow off. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE FOR WAX SERVICES. Then I complaint and she was clueless. Dumbest person I have ever had to talk to. I asked for a complaint form and she literally gave me a notebook sheet. I explained to her what a complaint form was and she had no clue. I called her boss on the phone and she was rude and unprofessional. I am going back there today to get a refund. Please, stay away of this place and just spend a couple more bucks and go to a better salon.

Went here for lunch and loved it, and ended up coming for late night too! The food is delicious and cheap and the drinks aren't steep either. Booths are super comfy and the seating by the huge windows makes for great people-watching.


 -Caprese - Great starter to share with another. Mozzarella has lots of flavor and the tomatoes are fresh. Could use a little more basil.
-Steak sandwich - You pretty much get an entire steak wedged between yummy bread with a tasty bearnaise sauce in the middle.
-Goat cheese & roasted pepper panini - Really nice. Not too filling and lovely flavor


 This is a great late-night place with DJ playing eclectic music, stays open until at least 2 a.m., and crowd is diverse.

 -Chicken BLT - the chicken and bacon were delicious but the flat bread was completely burnt so all I could taste was char. Side salads were yummy though.


 I like that they use seasonal and fresh ingredients, but the way it's presented isn't the best. The breakfast items people ordered around me looked tasty though!

Love this little place! Really friendly and cozy environment, lovely home-made food, and milkshakes! I split a panini and wrap with my friend (can't remember which ones) and they were both delicious and came with nice side-salads. Service was quick and easy and they have yummy home-made desserts.

I love everything about this place, and after having been there for brunch and dinner, I can say with much confidence that this is a prime eating/drinking location in Pittsburgh. 

Brunch
We arrived, and the host let us know that we could sit at any location, and we chose the bar. The bartender Carrie was awesome! She was able to mix whatever combination was asked for, and she was very attentive to detail. She even wrote down the recipe for a cocktail that I loved! Who does that?!

We ordered the pork and beef meatballs that came on a bed of grits and capers with a tangy tomato sauce. Yum! 
Also split the espresso burger with rosemary aioli and the potatoes with hollandaise sauce. Everything was rich and filling, and all three of us were satiated at the conclusion of the brunch. 

Wonderful experience and can't wait to return!

My favorite part of the restaurant is the aesthetics. They've brought together contemporary and rustic in a very cute way, and I just enjoyed being there. 

We ordered the well-known pork steam buns, and they were savory and flavorful. The pork is all sauced up, and they pair it with pickled vegetables and a gooey bun.

I ordered the see yew with a spice level of 2, knowing that I wanted something with a tiny kick, but that I can't stand too much spice. The noodles were fat and done to perfection, and this dish reminded me of pad Thai without the peanuts. If you aren't tolerant of too much spice like me, do not go beyond level 2!

I snuck a bite of the Chiang Mai curry from my husband, and had he ordered it with chicken, it might have been my favorite of the table. 

Service was very good, and we were very pleased with the experience.

No doubt about it, this iteration of Tia Rosa is a five star joint.  Tonight our party of 4 ordered 4 very different dishes.  I myself had my favorite the chile rellano and again it is the best in town.   My BIL had a mole dish and raved about it.  The interior resembles the Tia Rosa on McKellips (now gone) and the menu benefits from the relationship.

Our server was Katherine and she was spot on.  I don't know how other Yelpers would give a super low rating; I mean what's not to like here.

Still a five-star restaurant. Once again, I had the Nuevo Chile Rellenos, and as I've said before it's the best Rellenos I have ever had. The surprise ingredient was pine nuts.

Our server was Shawn who earned a 30% tip for being attentive, intuitive, and added so much to our dining experience.  Others in our party had their favorite dishes and also raved about the quality of the food.  When in the East Valley this is the place to go 

I believe that all the magic from the prior location has been transferred to the new place on Higley.

We showed up on Friday night at 7pm and there was no wait for a table. Sweet. What's not so sweet is the good news ends there. 

We ordered some waters, a cocktail and the Cajun Cheese curds. We didn't get our waters and cocktail until we were half way done with the curds. Not OK. Those things are salty man! My Pimms cup was served in a hard plastic that reminded me of middle school lunches. Classy.

Our entrees  were OK my girlfriend had the fish tacos. They were pretty spicy but nothing too special. I had the catfish po boy with a side of sweet potato fries which were extra $. There were 7 fries. 7. I thought it was kinda ridiculous but the catfish po boy was huge. I didn't know how to eat it. I tried to smush it down but it was still too big to get my mouth around it. The bun was hard and maybe a little stale so that didn't make it any easier...

Service was painfully slow. Food was average. There are too many other better places to warrant a second visit.

I went here to get my Las Vegas Advisor (LVA) Pocketbook of Value (POV). It includes 132 (this year) coupons and offers for places in and around Vegas. I stop in here 2 or 3 times a year for other various gaming books that are value priced from time to time. The selection of books and their price tag varies throughout the year. I snagged a great poker book for a few bucks on clearance that normally retails for around $25.

In my experience, the staff is always friendly and helpful. There is never a wait and they get you in and out quickly.

The service is top-notch and as far as Mexican restaurants go this is one of the better spots in Vegas. The decor is bright and fun with a cheerful atmosphere. 

They have an extensive menu with a nice selection of seafood. I've tried the orange roughy and the camarones a la diabla but my go-to is the red snapper. It's a whole fish served fried or in garlic sauce with rice, salad and french fires. You can sub for beans or veggies. I usually do, it just doesn't feel like fries are the best option for this meal.

The guac is good and they serve a habanero salsa with a nice kick. It's not the standard salsa that comes to the table with the chips and bean dip, but if you request it they are happy to comply. There are no taps at the bar and the bottle selection is limited. The beer is not the main attraction at this bar, it's all about the margarita.

Tried this place for the first time after seeing it every time i drove to work, and so happy that I did. It was either Gangnam or Tofu Hut - this place blows Tofu Hut out of the water! So clean, great central location, hip atmosphere -- this is my new go-to spot for Korean BBQ. Mind you, this place is not all you can eat, but the plates of diff meats are decently priced. At approx 6-8 dollars, the portions they give you are very fair. 

For every yelp review, they offer you a free dessert of your choice. 

Try the salmon carpaccio and the dynamite shrimp (a bit spicy), but you def won't be sorry! 

They also give you free complimentary sides of various things: Mac salad, fish, spicy cucumber, Kim chi, etc. 

We most definitely will be back!

Just had to add: have the macaroons! They are delicious. I had the mango and green tea and my GF had the vanilla. (She said that the lava cake was not very good though--we waited quite some time and they offered us a free dessert of our choosing). 

Great place and food! Great staff! Great service!

Good place, good food, but as the others have said the seating area could use some more attention and los banos need a heavy dose of TLC.  

Avoid the 12 lunch rush if you are in a hurry otherwise certainly a place we will be back too when in the area..    I don't think they are open for dinner (but I not 100% sure on that) so the "concern" about getting there before dark should be a non-issue!

On a wet snowy Sunday afternoon, we bravely made the trek out to the famous St. Viateur Bagels. Since Fairmount was close, we decided to pick up some from there as well to compare to each other as well as to NY-style bagels. All in the name of research, people!

St. Viateur vs. Fairmount
Bagels from both locations were fresh from the oven and still warm when they were handed to us. I can't say that I preferred one over the other. Eventually, bagels from both locations were mixed up, and we couldn't pick out which ones came from where. They were also both great with cream cheese & smoked salmon.

Montreal vs. NY:
Both are respectable in their own way. NY counterparts are fluffier & thicker and can be taken more seriously as a meal. Montreal bagels are thinner with more crust to crumb ratio, best eaten as a snack, and I love snacks.

Overall, I enjoy all bagels, and refuse to play this silly game of favorites.

IKEA is one of those places that you avoid, but once you are inside, they've got you! You WILL walk out of there with something and it will probably be something you didn't think you needed.

I have never bought any large furniture here, but I love the shows rooms for ideas. I mostly buy little stuff for organization and also love the swedish food. I always get lox from their market and some of their IKEA brand coffee, because it is amazing.

You can jump right to the market place if you don't have time for the show room and they do have a great kids center as well.

I bought some little side tables and lap top tables here and they have been great. I spent next to nothing on them and they are great for the kids and for keeping my lap top out of the way till I need it. In fact, I am using my lap top desk right now!

Now, wear comfortable shoes and plan to spend the entire day if you do the show room too. 

I do think it is odd that last time I went I bought a wok and a set of magnets and I had no idea I needed either... I also got a wire with clips that I use to organize notes and paperwork on my walls. People always comment on the cool look of it.

I am not sure why there are two listings for this IKEA.

This is a good location, it is just like every other IKEA you have been to. 

There isn't a lot that I can say that has not been said, so I will give you my IKEA secrets.

Go to IKEA.com and sign up for the family card to get discounts. You get free coffee and a free ice cream cone with this as well.

You can look up products online ahead of time and get their aisle and bin number before you leave, print that out if you want to skip the showroom.

You can also see what is in stock online at your locale IKEA. This helps incase you are looking for something specific.

Wear comfortable shoes!

Empty your car out and measure where you have room or plan to tie stuff to the top if you are going to buy anything large. 

Plan to be here ALL DAY!

Plan to get ideas and take pictures perhaps.

If you have kids, they will enjoy the kids center where you can check them in, get a pager and they are allowed to play in there for an hour.  The pager will buzz if your kid needs you back sooner.

When you start the showroom, grab a few big yellow bags.

Walk the show room - it takes about an hour to do the whole thing without a lot of stopping, make sure to pick up anything you see that you want from the bins, you might not be able to find it again in the maze.

Break for lunch! At the end of the showroom is a cafeteria, swedish coffee is great, I love the LOX and they usually have some good sweets.

Then you will go downstairs and actually start shopping. 

The marketplace is about another hour and then you go into the warehouse where you get the larger stuff. 

If you are getting any larger stuff, make sure to grab a pallet cart.. you will  need it. Stuff is boxed and heavy.

If you buy anything that might have extra pieces, make sure you confirm what you need. A bed may have top bottom, slats, mid-beam and hardware all in different bins. You don't want to get home and realize you are missing a piece.

If it's not there when you look, ASK. They will check the back for you.

Want a deal - look in the AS IS section.. lots of good stuff there for discounted prices and usually someone else has already put it together for you.

If you have a lot of smaller stuff,  grab some blue bags as you check out. They are .59 cents each, but unless you want to carry a bunch of little items out..  they come in handy and are really re-usable. I always have a couple in my car.

You will buy something you don't  need. It's a given. But have fun and plan to leave tired!

I had an excellent experience here when I reserved a full sized car on my Avis Preferred account. We arrived around 1130pm due to a twice delayed flight on Friday of the big fight night weekend. I was honestly worried that they were going to run out of rental cars because of how busy the city was going to be that weekend. We took the shuttle from McCarran and walked right past the Avis counter, straight down to the Avis Preferred booth which had my name & reservation displayed onto the screen. Typically, your rental car's assigned parking space will be next to your name but mine said "see representative inside". 

I was greeted by a nice lady and I asked her to check what type of vehicle my fullsize rental was. She saw that I had more than 5 people in my group and she offered to upgrade me for free to a mini van since it was my first time renting with Avis as a preferred customer.  I thought that was awesome. It totally saved us from packing in the car and luggage and driving clear across the Strip to the SLS where we all had our rooms reserved. She went above & beyond my customer service expectation and I really appreciated it. It was a great start to a fun weekend for myself and all my friends. 

I recommend Avis for sure. Our minivan was a Kia  Sedona and it drove beautifully, was spacious, had so many controls at the ready, had plenty of luggage space and had an eco drive feature which I used whenever we were on surface streets sitting in traffic. Excellent rental. I will definitely rent with them again. Thanks Avis!

Always did love eating here... Back when it was just Aloha Cafe to us. Any trip to Vegas would involve a stop at the CAL (California Hotel) and a meal here. Never disappoints. Inexpensive and good. Never mind the wait in line. Everyone has to wait a lil bit to order their food.

I usually order the local plate. This includes beef & chicken teriyaki, 2 spam musubis and some macaroni salad. This order does NOT come with rice but that's okay because in my opinion, the spam musubis they make here come with WAY too much rice action. I usually pair this order with a wonton min (saimin noodle soup that comes with char siu pork & steamed wontons). Very good. This is a large soup order and can be shared... The garlic chicken is also a DELISH order of a meal. Tastes real good.

Don't forget the extra large fruit punch with your meal. You're gonna need it.

Great location for arena events. Centrally located in the city and works well for monthly commuters. I find the garage has easy entrances and exits either onto 5th street for 6th street. Even when it seems like a line to get it, it moves fairly consistently. 



The garage has definitely seen an uptick in daily parking traffic. They are competitively priced with the in by 8:30 deal being $6 per day currently (April 2015). With the uptick in usage, I do find that I have to drive to a higher level. But hey, it's the city what can you expect. 

One unique feature in this garage is the spiral entrance. Until noon or so, you can drive up the spiral and pull directly into a higher floor. So no weaving floor by floor. Then afternoons the spiral changes directions and you can head straight down. I only know of one other garage in Charlotte that has this (BB&T). 

Another unique feature is that you can walk through the Wake Forest garage and the 1 BAC garage into the 1 BAC building. Completely covered for those rainy days. Look for the skywalk on the 4th floor. 

Finally, the deck does get messy after large events with trash and such. But I see a janitor going through picking up fairly frequently. It's probably due to the higher amount of traffic and proximity to the arena.

This place has all the requirements necessary to be your typical drunken food stop. Open 24 hours, 2 drive thrus in which one isn't even used, located in a sketchy area of town, a less than stellar facade, lighted outdoor seating, and a walk-up window. Come to think of it, this reminds of quite a few taquerias in SoCal. 

It's a bit of a drive off the strip. If you're picking up or dropping off someone at the airport, this place is not that far down Tropicana. If you're coming from the eastern part of town and you're on the way to the Strip while craving Mexican food, you may see this and consider stopping. 

I ordered myself a carne asada burrito at midnight, and it was only 4 bucks. Sounds about right. Then, as I was eating it at home, I realized why it was only 4 doll hairs. For one, it did not include rice, beans, and sour cream, which I enjoy in all my burritos. I should have added that on. Damn. The burrito was basically a load of carne asada, onions, cilantro, and guacamole. At least every bite of had chunks of carne asada, but then again the meat was a little chewy and not as tender. The guacamole didn't taste as fresh, and they added a little too much onion. Best be sure your breath will stank after eating this. The tortilla seemed like it was microwaved instead of steamed. The edges were still dry and hard (potential that's what she said?). 

Honestly, its a less than stellar burrito. If I try this while buzzed or drunk, I might say otherwise. I'll give Felipito's props for being open 24 hours and serving carne asada fries. Why I didn't try it instead is beyond me.

Eggspectation is a great place to get brunch or breakfast. The brunch portions are well-sized and they are mostly $15 and under. I had a Benedict that had perfectly cooked eggs and perfectly toasted English muffin. The potatoes that accompanied were great, too. Service is very good here as well.

Osco is a modern French establishment located at the InterContinental. The service here is very good. Great wine list as well. The food is also great. I had a risotto and duck confit. While the duck was not the best I've had, it was still very good and prepared to my expectations. Risotto was good, too.

What can I say? It delivers exactly what it promises. It's a classic staple for every small child's memory bank. Mediocre pizza, upbeat music, kids running wild, coins and tokens out the wazoo. 

The good side to this "PeeWee's Playhouse":
Both the parent and the child get a matching invisible number stamped on their arm upon entering which is then checked when exiting, so you know the kid can't leave with some one else. 
Hand sanitizer is provided at the entrance and outside the bathrooms. 
Chuck-E does a fun song and dance for all the kids to participate in and then collect free tickets at the end to redeem for cheap prizes. 
It's a pretty tame place during the weekdays.

I'm going to defy the norm here:

Westgate is superb.  There are a ton of dining options, bars, a movie theater, and it is very close the the football stadium (and it is joined to the hockey arena).  There aren't many retail shops though.

The Yardhouse is definitely my top choice for happy hour.  Kabuki runs the second best happy hour on a Friday and Buffalo Wild Wings has their wing specials on Tuesday and Thursday.

I also enjoy getting my haircut at MUG, where you get the extra perks (razor finish with a hot towel and massage).  The movie theater is also generally solid.  The center courtyard also has a fountain/ play area where kids usually run through in their bathing suits as their parents relax in the surrounding sofas.  

So, there are definitely some good options here that have kept me coming back for more.

I REALLY want to give this place 5 stars but due to the service I simply cannot.  But the food was AH-mazing.  Some of the best chicken I've ever had.  

Had the chicken burrito combo, and although the rice and beans were just OK, I thought I might cry right into my platter because the chicken burrito was so delicious.  The chicken was so tender and juicy... ohmygawd I am drooling just thinking about it, and I am still overwhelmingly full from the meal.  The burrito also had onions (both white and green) and cilantro (YES PLEASE!) which I'm sure added to the overall deliciousness.  

Sadly the service was less than stellar and SUPER slow (and I was the ONLY one in the restaurant so no excuses), but their food (and cheap prices!) will certainly get me coming back.  Nom nom nom.

I live about 10-15 minutes from here and drive by on occasion and have been wanting to check it out. I finally had an excuse to go, as I wanted to find/buy some unique gifts to ship to my brother for his birthday. 

I came to QCOM on a Thursday mid-day and you would have thought it was Saturday afternoon with as busy as it was. There was plenty of parking however, and I didn't have to bump too many elbows to get some of their tasty samples of tapenades and olive oils. I did however have to wait in a long line to order my lunch, which I wasn't too thrilled about considering there was a managerial-looking guy behind the counter, not looking like he was doing much other than standing around. 

I ordered the Manzi panini based on the suggestion of the lady taking my order - grilled chicken breast, fontina cheese, basil, sun-dried tomato tapenade and one of their balsamic vinaigrettes. Overall it was "good" but COULD have been fantastic if they hadn't been stingy on the tapenade and/or balsamic. It just didn't have that much flavor honestly. The bread was tasty though as were the "gourmet chips" they served along side the sandwich. 

For the panini and drink, I paid just over $12. A little steep in my opinion. 

Still, I love the variety of goodies you can get hear (all kinds of olives, tapenades, dressings, oils, vinegars, etc) and I will definitely be back here when I have guests in from out of town. I just hope the next panini I order has a bit more oomph.

All toppings are free including: mayo, relish, onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, A-1 Sauce, bar-b-q sauce and hot sauce. 

I always get a bacon cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, green peppers and bar-b-q sauce! YUM 

They also offer kosher style hot dogs, cheese or bacon dogs, bacon cheese dogs, veggie dogs and grilled cheese. 

Fries are available in two styles, regular and cajun and are cooked in peanut oil. 

Be sure to grab some peanuts while you wait for your food.

I've gone here three times and each time with a different group. I have never ate here so I'm reviewing on games and booze.

First off, I think every time I've walked in the door I was greeted with two things - a bouncer checking IDs and a nice strong whiff of beer. Hello, if you didn't already know it... you're in a bar.

The place is kind of broken in to 3 parts - a bar, a restaurant, and a game room (billiards, ping-pong, darts, video games, air hockey, shuffleboard, etc.). I've played them all and I've enjoyed all the games. This is a pretty good place to just mess around with friends and BS and quite honestly this kind of reminds me of bars in Ohio where I'm from, albeit a bit more upscale since there is more. There is a lot of pool tables, so I would say that if you did have to wait, you wouldn't have to wait long. There is at least 4 tables.

I don't remember my bill total, but generally I get here and just play games or only have one drink. So I can't really even comment on the pricing.

I read somewhere that the Crypt/Asylum was one of the better haunted houses in Arizona. While I can't say that I've visited a lot of haunted houses, I'd be really disappointed if this was the best.

With that said, in full disclosure, every year I always long to go to a legitimate haunted house such as Haunted Hoochie in Ohio, Dead of Night in New York, ScareHouse: Basement in New York, The Cult in New Hampshire, Blackout in California, and the Freakling Bros: Victim Experience III in Nevada. These are not the type of haunted houses that people jump out of a dark corner and startle you... these are haunted houses that make you walk in alone, in the dark, may abduct you, may force you to watch certain things (no hiding your eyes), and will certainly put their hands on you.

So needless to say... any haunted house that simply tries to startle you isn't going to do it for people like me.

With that said, the people who are simply looking to walk into a dark room and be startled and/or have an excuse to break their boyfriend's hand... this is a fine place to visit. Even if it is not a super scary place it is a nice place to get into the spirit a little more than you would without it.

In 2015 there was an express line that would cost you an extra $10 on top of your ticket. This line had nobody in it. The main line will net you an hour wait for each house. It isn't super bad to wait as they have people going around in the crowd and scaring people as well as a movie with scary movies playing on it so it seems to go fast. Your feet may not agree with it feeling fast, but you'll have to decide on whether or not the extra cost is worth it.

PRO TIP: Look on Groupon at the beginning of the season and see if this place is included. I think we paid $35 for two tickets on Groupon and when we got there the tickets were $40 for one ticket.

I've been going here for about 3 years now and never had a problem with them. Along the same lines, I've been attended to by everyone there, I believe.

I've had them give me everything from a buzz cut to a faux hawk to a beard shave.

Their prices are pretty reasonable at $17 for a normal cut (but +$3 on Sundays). 

About the only thing I can say "bad" is that if you are looking for a big chat fest, this isn't the place. Everyone there is pretty quiet and just watches the TVs that are along the wall. But then again... this is a barber shop, not a beauty salon!

I tend to avoid chain BBQ. Nothing is less authentic than a cookie cutter chain. But Rudy's... they do a fine good job of making you forget that you are actually at a chain location. The moist brisket is insanely good! The true to Texas style cafeteria pay by the pound lay out, reminds you, you might be at a chain, but you are at the best darn chain in Texas.

(That's why they got 2 and not one star)

For $8 I got what they called a breakfast wrap which is nothing more than a bad breakfast burrito. Maybe Mexico sued them, "a ese, this is no burrito, this is caca." Who knows, but I was greasy, gross, and the sausage taste like dog treats.

And yes I have sampled dog treats, but that's a story for another day.

The ONLY reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have pretty good sushi.  HOWEVER - the hype about this place is so overdone that the staff has a huge attitude and they do not know how to treat guests.  

My husband and I went around 7:30 on a Thursday night.  We were staying at the Venetian (the hotel connected to the restaurant), made reservations for both the restaurant and the nightclub.  After waiting an HOUR we finally got a table.  The place was dark, loud, and the layout made you feel very crowded.  It was difficult to see what we were eating, let alone have a conversation.  We dropped about $400 on dinner (we were celebrating and had a bottle of Veuve).  

After dinner was over, we said we had reservations for the nightclub, the entrance to the club was literally 20 feet from our table.  Well, we had to get up, go outside the club, stand in a long "special line" and then wait in another "special line" in order to pay a $20 cover to go back through the restaurant we just left, back up the stairs we just came down, in order to get in.  

Pathetic.  

When we got inside, it got even worse.  The place was packed (it was only 10:30 p.m.!).  The bouncers were rude, the place was pitch black in some places - so it was a lot of bumping into people.  I would estimate that about 80% of every room in the entire club was sectioned off for VIP.  So unless you are ready to drop $300 on a $40 bottle of vodka, don't expect to have any room.

I'm surprised this place is still open. I'm too scared to see what their health ratings have been. I'm positive I won't be back and I LOVE hole in the wall places. 

Servers were friendly. Slow as molasses but friendly. Coffee was not warm. Water tasted like dirt and the cups and glasses I'm sure had been used for 10 years. They were severely stained. 

The dining area itself was an odd mix of meet able items from Ikea and old falling apart chairs and weird wicker hanging lights. The kitchen area as I was paying grossed me out. Had I seen this first we wouldn't have eaten there. 

I had biscuits and gravy a half portion. Cold at best. Biscuit was good. Gravy was good. A little salty but I like that. 

The eggs were cooked on the outside but inside was VERY runny. I asked for scrambled. It came out like a unfinished omelet. The bacon. Wow. Not. Cooked. Like straight from the wrapper to the plate. No lie. 

The bathroom was ridiculous and I'll skip those details. Overall bill was like $16 but not worth it at all. Won't back here. Good luck if you go!

I'm surprised this place is still open. I'm too scared to see what their health ratings have been. I'm positive I won't be back and I LOVE hole in the wall places. 

Servers were friendly. Slow as molasses but friendly. Coffee was not warm. Water tasted like dirt and the cups and glasses I'm sure had been used for 10 years. They were severely stained. 

The dining area itself was an odd mix of new items from Ikea and old falling apart chairs and weird wicker hanging lights. The kitchen area as I was paying grossed me out. Had I seen this first we wouldn't have eaten there. 

I had biscuits and gravy a half portion. Cold at best. Biscuit was good. Gravy was good. A little salty but I like that. 

The eggs were cooked on the outside but inside was VERY runny. I asked for scrambled. It came out like a unfinished omelet. The bacon. Wow. Not. Cooked. Like straight from the wrapper to the plate. No lie. 

The bathroom was ridiculous and I'll skip those details. Overall bill was like $16 but not worth it at all. Won't back here. Good luck if you go!

I don't throw the following sentence out very often but when I do, I mean business so here it goes...I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten here. I am not exaggerating. So if you stop reading this review right this second, at least you know and now you can you get into the car, make your way to Mesa and try one for yourself. 

So on to the rest of the review. I've been lucky enough to have an Ike's sandwich in SF and couldn't believe my eyes when I found out they were moving to Arizona. Their location is a bit of a drive for me, but the sandwich truly makes it worth it. 

Here's how the experience works. This is a casual sandwich eatery where you can come in solo, order and take it to go, or dine in with a couple friends. Anything goes at Ike's. Now, when you walk in, you'll immediately be overwhelmed by a board listing off a variety of every sandwich combo imaginable and it's not your run of the mill sandwich combo. No way. It's a combo of everything good in life that's put in between two slices of bread and served either hot or cold, depending on your sandwich. I suggest looking at Yelp reviews, pictures and the menu before you arrive to avoid major menu anxiety like I experienced. Also, note that every sandwich has a hilariously funky name so you might get lost in translation just simply reading the names! 

Once you've made your sandwich selection, you'll order at the counter from one of the incredibly friendly staff and they are truly genuinely friendly! It was such a breath of fresh air to experience a sandwich at Ike's. The decor is just as fun and funky as the staff and sandwich choices and be sure to look on your napkin holder because it will tell you something pretty about you! 

Now on to the best part, the sandwich. I don't even know where to begin. First, they serve this special bread that typically can only be found in N. Cal and it's amazing. Cheese is baked into the bread. I tried the Bella which is their most popular and I'm not surprised. It's a combo of chicken that has been slow-cooked for several hours and then tossed in this delicious honey mustard. Then they top it with cheese, avocado and this special mayo spread. I suggest adding some hot sauce to it. It's served hot and it is large and in charge, so unless you're ready for a last supper meal you will probably have some left-overs or your might want to share. It's worth every single calorie consumed and then some. 

Now, although this is about a 15-20 minute drive from my house, I will absolutely be visiting on a regular basis and can't wait for them to open additional locations!

PS - if you get lost, it's across the street from the mall!

If every restaurant could take a lesson from Paul Martin's on how to perfect the quality of food and customer service, bad Yelp reviews wouldn't exist. I am writing this review on a full stomach of delicious cuisine, but it was more than just good food. It was the excellent experience in general. 

First off, they accept reservations which is a huge plus during the busy season. We made a reservation and upon arrival, we were seated right away. From the moment we sat down until the moment we left, it was a pleasant experience. Our waiter Jeremy is 50% responsible for the great experience. He greeted us as if we were personal VIP guests of Paul Martin's American Grill (which we were not, just random customers). He was incredibly knowledgeable and educated us on the brand, food and history of Paul Martin's. I had no idea this restaurant is a concept of and owned by Mr. Fleming of Fleming's Steakhouse. All of their food is made in-house from scratch and much of it is sourced locally form Arizona. I gained so much knowledge in such a short period of time, without ever feeling like I was being talked at. It was just friendly conversation by Jeremy who is truly passionate about Paul Martin's and it shows. 

Jeremy pointed us in the right direction with everything we ordered and I'm glad we took his advice! We started with the calamari which is not your average rubbery calamari. No, this is cod calamari and it seriously puts any other calamari to shame. The seasonings and freshness of the dish made it taste so good I didn't want the dish to end. We almost didn't get it at first because we figured it would just be like every other calamari we had, but we were definitely wrong. 

For dinner, I had the short ribs and mashed potatoes, thanks to Jeremy's suggestion. The meat was tender, juicy and flavorful with each and every bite. The mashed potatoes were just as amazing as the short ribs themselves. For dessert, I gobbled up several bites of the pear and huckleberry cobbler which was delectable to the core and topped with their homemade ice cream. 

Between the combination of excellent service from Jeremy and delicious food from Paul Martin's, I'd say this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in awhile. I just wish we had given this restaurant a try much earlier! Now we will definitely find our way back again soon. 

PS 

- They offer brunch on the weekend for just $14 for a pre-fixe menu. I can't wait to try it!

Delicious and cool looking spot. We ordered duck confit and sweet potato cannelloni, shrimp, lamb shank, eggplant parm, and a bianco pizza. I would say the pizza was the least memorable so I'm glad we focused on the apps. Everything else was delicious and very well balanced in terms of flavour and presentation. Our server was super nice and we would definitely come back here for dinner. A must-try!

This is a hood Walmart and I like that.  When Jeezy is pumpin through the store and the electronics section looks like a club full of dancing people, you just have to love it.  The store setup was different than most walmarts im used to, but I can always find what im looking for. Plus i usually just run in here for the essentials anyway.  Greeters are always nice ( my dream job) and they check your receipt on the way out.  This makes me reminisce of living in the hood in Jersey, though they would circle my total there.  This place is never too busy so the lines usually only have one person in front of you.  Thats a huge plus.  The only thing that I agree with is that the cashiers are usually preoccupied with something else.  Though I really dont care, im at wally world and I am just trying to get in and get out.

I haven't had their food yet, but their wine and beer selection is one of the best in Charlotte. THere is a nice little seating area, and a bar area where you can order beer and wine.  They always have some good beer on tap and you can order a half pint.  The beer selection is well organized.  From normal craft stuff in the cooler to a selection dedicated to Belgians and sours.  Def check it out if you are in the area.

I am the Duke of Chipotle.  Bow to me.

I like this location a lot.  The food is, of course, Chipotleish.  The service helps set it apart.  The crew is fast and incredibly attentive.  I have had several of the prep guys look at the ingredients, decide they weren't fresh enough, and get new for me.

Fine place to stop in for a burrito.  Outside of that, it's Chipotle- you just know you can't go wrong.

A wonderful place to get the nicest organic veggies, bulk grains and nuts, fresh bread, fresh flowers, natural pharmacy items and restricted-diet-friendly foods.  Watch out for high prices on fresh seafood, non-organic (regular) vegetables, some prepared foods and non-specialty items. 

This location has a beautiful layout and an excellent selection.  It's also staffed with helpful, friendly people!  I've needed help finding something many, many times so I've definitely done the research on that.

I'll admit it.  It took me a long time to come around to liking Whole Foods.  Sure, it's beautiful and clean and every single piece of produce looks like it could win a prize, but I hated feeling shafted - just look at the seriously exorbitant prices on plain old grapes or peaches.  

Then, my husband and I decided to eat mostly organic for a month.  We quickly discovered that prices are pretty consistent for organic produce wherever you go, but far and away the best quality is at Whole Foods.  

While we were there, we discovered that they have a wonderful selection of specialty items (calling all food freaks - if you need [insert food here]-free, they got it!).  It's a wonderful place to find variety and quality if you are trying to eat "clean" or remove something from your diet (lots of coconut-milk-based dairy alternatives, tons of gluten-free options).  The prices on these types of items are higher wherever you go, so, once again, you might as well bask in the glorious perfection (and selection) at Whole Foods. 

They have wonderful variety, quality and price in the bulk section! Need some organic cous cous or buckwheat, brown rice or quinoa? Grab some here! They even sell cheap mason jars to store all of these goodies.  Our pantry is packed full of them, now, and it's a beautiful and inexpensive way to store things so that you can see them! 

The fresh flowers and fresh bread are excellent, as is the selection of supplements and moisturizers.  

In summary, I still haven't found a way to use the salad bar without feeling robbed, but there are some wonderful deals on quality items to be found here!

The quintessential college-town-type dive bar with an interesting layout, a big mixed crowd, fun music and plenty of bars selling fairly crappy cheap drinks.  A little seedy, a little crowded, a little cigarette-smoky (some of it is outdoor, so they somehow get away with this yuckiness).  Four stars for being really good at exactly what it is.

This place is definitely a must on any Old Town pub crawl - however, not really recommended as hangout for a group of adults on a nice night out.

Finally found a good Mexican place in Vegas! So I tell my husband I want Mexican for dinner and he tells me he found a place his coworker heard about. We get there and we were like what the heck it's Sapphire gentlemen's club! Pretty funny but thank goodness it's separate from the club, just right next door. No glitter found in our tacos :)

Service was great! We sat at the bar and the guy serving us was so friendly and the chef came out to bring us our flan which was free for checking in. He gave us his card and asked us how everything was and said to enjoy his grandmas recipe. It was really creamy and delish, passed the husband test since he's a flan snob :)

We got the Siegal dinner send spicy chipotle tostadas, cilantro rice was yum! Also tried the tres leche in addition to flan.  White Sangria and Brazilian wax for drinks!

Will definitely be regulars.  Was just talking about how there wasn't any good Mexican restaurants in Vegas besides the fast food street taco places, but now I know! What a gem with nice people and good food with decent prices. Leaving full and happy!

My trip out here was actually quite a let down. It was a Sunday morning and we had no plans and wanted to do something a little different so after seeing a commerical with the sparkling waters and the awesome looking shopping and dining it looked like we had found our Sunday afternoon destination. 

We loaded up the car and began out 35 minute drive out there to first drive by a completely dead golf course on the way in, which we let go since we had not made the trip out there to golf. Following the signs it led us to the casino parking garage and we thought we had made it to this awesome desert oasis. 

This is when things went south, It is very unfortunate because this could be a great place but walking through the shopping area was like watching disney's Cars when they all freak out because they have customers coming down the street. It really felt that way, Most of the buildings are vacant and the few that were not had the shop owners/keepers sitting out front basically asking you to come inside and look around. It was more of the PLEEEAAASSSEEE come in, not a hey, how is your afternoon come take a look. 

I did feel a little dooped into coming out there, the TV commercial that aired showed this amazing lively happening place to go and that could not have been further from the truth. Unfortunately I have to say I don't think I will be back.

I could only eat a few of them and after my big tall glass of milk arrived, I went ahead and ordered the philly cheese with Jack mac which is mac and cheese with a little kick. They were both awesome but I might need to tone it down on the hot sauce after being put in my place.

Had to try it, not bad not sure it's for me though.  I had the veal chop.  Other than being slightly overcooked, (asked for med rare, got pretty heavy med). Other than that it was still a pretty darn good veal chop.  Couple others had the scallops which were amazing.  Our other companion had the ribeye, also amazing.  The crab fried rice was fantastic!

The thing with a bookstore is that they have to do a lot to compete with the likes of Amazon.  Unfair?  Maybe, but true.  It's just so easy to order online, and you know that you'll be able to find what you're looking for.  When you go into a bookstore, you risk them either not carrying or being out of what you want.

BUT - when you buy online, you miss out.  Have you ever wandered into a bookstore for one thing and come out with an arm-full?  I do that, a lot.  I can't help myself.  Books I've never head of are cleverly displayed which makes me pick them up and read the jacket and realise that it sounds fabulous, so I buy and subsequently love it.  Now that's an experience you wouldn't have online.

Anyway... the Edinburgh Bookshop manages to serve up the benefits of going to an actual bookstore (paired with incredibly lovely, helpful, and impressively knowledgeable staff - bonus!) with the convenience of shopping online.  By that I mean that they will happily order anything you like.  And, if they can't get it for any reason, they'll let you know how and where you can order it yourself.  

Seeing as it's located directly next to my bus stop, this makes it *more* convenient, and certainly more enjoyable than shopping online.

I'm definitely a convert.

Cramond as a wee village/neighborhood is beautiful.  It has a beach, a pub, a river, and woodland walks.  It also has Cramond Island.

I think Cramond Island is pretty cool, but then I love walking/hiking exploring abandoned buildings/ruins.  You can reach the island on a walkway that's only exposed during low tide.  Fortunately the coast guard (probably tired of having to pick folk up who got trapped) has posted times when the "island" is accessible. 

In my opinion it's definitely worth a bit of exploring on a sunny afternoon, as long as you keep an eye on the time!

One of the Top 5 restaurants in Charlotte, hands down! Maybe even our favorite but it's just so hard to pick. The pork belly small plate is a must. All of their meats are locally sourced and always perfectly seasoned and cooked. Sides are well thought out and complement the main without fail. I love their wild game specials. Things like venison and boar shine. Great beer and wine selection. Excellent desert. Even their coffee (French press) is to die for!

We had take out from Omaggio Tuesday night. The antipasti was a delicious mix of cured meats, marinated veggies and Italian cheeses. We ordered the special pizza (like a glorified supreme) with sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms & onions. I wish we'd ordered something different, with less toppings as the pizza felt kind of heavy and the crust/sauce/cheese were over shadowed by all the other stuff. We'll be back for sure and I look forward to trying out the Margherita or maybe the Pear & Gorgonzola oh! or the Classico... You get the idea. ;)

9/10/15 UPDATE:
We went back for more takeout late tonight. Despite breezing in just 30 minutes before closing, everyone greeted us like we were old friends and they just couldn't be happier to see us! They not only remembered my boyfriend from the previous visit a week+ ago, they also remembered his name and order. It's so rare to find a place with both amazing food AND service. This place really has it all. As promised, we ordered a pizza with less toppings. (See below for my review of the Omaggio Special -- good but weighed down with too much stuff.) This time we had just sausage and arugula -- my favorite pizza from my time in Italy. It did not disappoint, even made me a little homesick for Tuscany and my favorite pizzeria in Ponsacco! We also had the meatballs and ricotta. Trust me on this one. You MUST order the meatballs and ricotta. It is melt in your mouth delicious. They threw in an order of garlic knots on the house just because. Remember what I said about the outstanding service? If you haven't already enjoyed a meal here, go now! 

9/1 ORIGINAL REVIEW:

Ready for a whirlwind roller coaster ride? Than Town Square is your place. Town Square is just so diverse that you get people of all walks of life there. They've got lots and lots of shops for people who rock every style. They've got lots of great restaurants and it is home to some of my favorite bars. 

Because there are so many different things to do and everything has its own style, this is a prime place for people watching. I can't tell you how many times my best friend and I will just grab some froyo (because yes there is even a froyo place), sit on a bench, and just watch all the people walking by. 

No matter what kind of experience you're looking for, you can find it at Town Square! Want to hit up a dicey college bar? Check out McFaddens. Want a slightly classier experience with a more adult feel? Double Helix is your place. Want some good country music, fireball, and straight up line dancing? The Las Vegas Bull is the place for you. Pretty much every scene is covered here. And I've definitely spent a night or two just bar hopping around Town Square. 

It's not just bars and restaurants. Lots of great shops. Some chains and some local shops. Coffee and tea shops. Really, whatever you need I'm almost positive you'll find it here!!

Love the vibes here! Definitely a great environment to just grab a few drinks with people and chill. I haven't had their food, but they definitely mix good cocktails. The bartenders offer great service! They are attentive, quick, and entertaining. The two guys who were bar tending when we were there had us laughing all night and took good care of us. We will definitely be going back. The only thing that was slightly off putting... And this is minor... Was that at the bar there are machines and the management has the bartenders put signs on the seats that say "these seats are reserved for players only." I can understand they want to make more money, but there are no bar seats without player machines. From experience I've gotten better service at the bar than when at a table with a server, so I prefer sitting at the bar. So that caught me off guard. Otherwise, though, everything was awesome!

Really disappointed with tonight's service!!!!!!! That's why i almost neverrrrr dine inside.. And always order take out. The tall older bald guy was so slow and never paid attention! He just didn't care about me ! I dont get why you work at a nice fancy professional resto if you cant represent the professionalism.. He claimed he was "SO BUSY" but it was like 10pm and no body was around at all!!! the poor new waiter had to apologize for his delay. We were finally ready to order and I ordered from the other cute waiter.but i asked him questions on the menu and he didn't know what to reply. I find it's very sad that the resto doesn't take the time to teach the newer workers the entire menu and at least make them taste what it is for better efficiency and they can make more customers happy by recommending them foods because theyve tried it all!!!!

Anyways, thankfully the food is always delicious !!! I had grilled shrimps, veggies and grilled tuna salad yumm! Too bad they dont have pictures next to the food .. Because it would really help as well .. Some people eat with their visual eyes

Once you have perfectly pulled espresso from Myriade you will never enter or even look at a chain coffee shop again. Specialty coffee is where it's at and Myriade does it right. 

Expertly pulled shots every time. 

Lattes, cappuccinos pare perfectly proportioned. 

Baristas always have fun with latte art. 

Bonus: the baked look great and the few I have tried do no disappoint.

This is the perfect place to grab a quick slice of pizza.  Whether you're hung over or have a craving for pizza this is a good place to go.  I really like that they have 2 locations (one off of Warm Springs and LV Blvd and the Paradise location).    

We've gone in for pizza by the slice and have ordered ahead for the full meal.  They have chicken wings, salads, and calzones.  I really like their Chicken and Pesto Pizza.  Another favorite is the Barbeque Chicken Pizza!  As always, you can't go wrong with cheese or pepperoni!  

PS:  Get a side of their ranch...dip your pizza in it!  It's the best ranch ever!  Love it!

I was disappointed with the menu and the overall experience. The building is a large metal shack. The menu is a few panini's and unimaginative salads. 

I ordered the chopped salad with chicken for $14 and my guest ordered a panini which was a small portion with chip for $10. I wasn't wowed by the dry chicken or non-chopped salad (whole olives and torn lettuce leaves).

The "service" was line up and place your order at the register with an unhappy employee. With self service should come the self service prices. 

I wouldn't bother making the drive to go back. If you are so inclined the breakfast menu looks best. Otherwise visit their satellite stores for the actual oils and vinegars. No need to drive 20 miles out of town for this spot.

First time at Jersey Mikes today. Arrived at 11:45 for lunch and there were a dozen guests plus three in line. 

I ordered a regular Italian with no frills for $7.80 with tax. The service was efficient if a bit fast. Seemed they were competing with Jimmy Johns for speed. I like my meal in a hurry but I don't like to be rushed. The guy in line behind me was completely flustered since they talk so fast you can't hear or understand them. They also had to add some condiments to my sub that they had missed. 

On to the food: the bread was fresh, baked just right with a slightly crunchy crust and soft middle. The veggies were crisp and the meat/cheese were sliced to order. The portions seemed a bit slight compared to Port of Subs but there were options, like pepper relish, that POS doesn't offer. 

I will return to JM again and try a hot sandwich.

Came back to Mike's for an Italian sandwich today. The line moved quickly. In fact, as my sandwich was being finished, they hustled me thru the cashier and I didn't get to see that they screwed up my order. My toppings were not done as requested, which was a problem due to allergies. I had to toss the meal out when I got to work. 

Mike: you might want to think that one through. Fast service isn't better than good service.

First time at this Smashburger. Kinda weird tho: 6:00 PM on a Monday and I'm the only customer. The Smash by my old house in Las Sendas was always packed from 4:00 PM until closing. Win for me I guess. 

Ordered two burgers to go. Obviously I got fast service with no other customers. Cashier tried a soft upsell, which I am always fine with hearing. I declined though. I ordered a regular sized burger on a chipotle bun and my wife got a regular with a lettuce bun. 

Her burger was a bit disappointing though because the lettuce was very small, forcing her to eat it with knife and fork, instead of a lettuce wrap. 

Mine was fine, with fresh ingredients and toppings. 

I'll try this Smash again but will check her lettuce wrap before leaving the restaurant.

First time at George and Sons. Came here on recommendation and dragged her here for confirmation. 

We arrived at noon on a Tuesday and there were only 4 empty tables which was a good sign. We ordered our drinks, which arrived promptly but then our glasses were ignored until we were ready for the check. 

I got the lunch special General Yang's Chicken, which came with Egg Drop Soup, Rice, a small Egg Roll, a small Crab Puff and, of course, the entree. Plenty to eat for $8. 

The chicken was plenty hot, plenty crisp, too sweet but overall it was good. We never saw our server again and had to flag down the hostess to get our check. 

I give the food 4 1/2 stars, the service 1 star, so why 4 stars overall?  Because George was walking the floor, checking on his customers. That says that he cares. He needs to check his own servers however and then he will be packed for lunch. 

I recommend George's but be prepared to wait.

Tried George's again after a few months. Went solo on a Tuesday evening. I arrived at 5 and there was one other customer. Too early?

I ordered Crab Puffs, Hot and Sour Soup and General Yang's Chicken. The puffs arrived in 5 mins. All six were hot and fresh. More cream cheese/scallion than cream cheese/crab flavor.  Still good tho. The soup, which was very hot, had just the right amount of pork plus a big shrimp in the cup. 

The Yang's Chicken was excellent. It was extremely spicy (yay), crispy (yay) and not as sweet as last visit (yay). Very good dish, if you like spice, which I do. 

The only thing that was off:  the 80s music. They spent a lot of thought making the place look oriental and then they pipe in loud Billy Joel. Some quality oriental music would've been preferable.

The TSA looks over your ID's pretty carefully but with a sense of humor.  It never seems there is a long line at least not like Denver's.  I have found an 11/2 is more than enough time at least the times I have been through the Phoenix Airport.

I will return many times.  I love this area with all the cactus and hot weather.  Plus my kids are here.  What more do I need.

Glad they're open 24 hours, but it would be nice to have more than 3 servers available. Hungry after a night at Surrender. Waited in line for at least 20 minutes for a table for four. My high heels were killing me. I opted for a breakfast item, French Toast and everything came out alright. Sad that they only sell/serve the pho menu items until 2:30am on Fri/Sat. Second day, during daytime hours, we had just come in after a pool party at Encore Beach Club and they refused to serve/seat us until my friend wearing a crop top, shorts, and flipflops "put a shirt on." It's not like we were wearing bikini tops and see-through sarong wraps! They don't take to-go orders, so we just ordered two bowls of pho through room service. Lame. Gave 'em one last try after a late night at Drais, and their Vietnamese menu was still available. Shrimp and pork spring rolls came with peanut sauce (loaded with chopped peanuts) and were just okay, wrapped tightly and didn't fall apart. I got the grilled pork over rice vermicelli noodles and it came with the same peanut sauce as the spring rolls. Shouldn't it come with a spicy fish sauce with shredded carrots? It was a pretty huge bowl though, and I was able to finish all the meat and some veggies. Easily twice as much as a bowl I could get back home in Little Saigon.

Modern-Asian bistro? I do admit the 27ft crystal dragon was impressive, and the hostess was kind enough to take our order right away since we were in a hurry. Since we were headed to Surrender following the meal, wanted to keep it light. I chose the eel/avocado (unagi) sushi roll for $12. When it came out it only had 6 pieces and a pile of ginger. I was so hungry and sad at the same time. Not even hangry. The other girl got the drunken noodles with shrimp ($24) and that came out pretty spicy so I couldn't eat any of that either. If we weren't in a rush I may have considered something more substantial such as Egg Noodle Soup with wonton or BBQ pork ($17). Expensive but nice ambience.

I love Il Pizzaiolo and will definitely be back! Italian food is one of my favorites and I am always looking for places that do it authentically and that do it right! Il Pizzaiolo totally nailed it in my opinion! 

While the dining area is on the small side and it did get pretty loud (keep this in mind because it could be an issue), the food was delicious.  From my wedding soup and veggie antipasti to my pasta pomodora and cannoli, I was completely satisfied and enjoyed every bite. Only improvement could be that the wedding soup was slightly under salted. The pomodora was perfectly seasoned and I could eat that cannoli every day! It actually had ricotta filling as it should! 

Service was fast and friendly although our waiter did struggle a bit to remember our order. Regardless, it was a fantastic experience and I will absolutely be back for another delicious meal. Totally worth the price in my opinion!

From my wedding soup and veggie antipasti to my pasta pomodoro and cannoli, I was completely satisfied and enjoyed every bite. Only improvement could be that the wedding soup was slightly under salted. The pomodoro was perfectly seasoned and I could eat that cannoli every day! It actually had ricotta filling as it should! 

Service was fast and friendly although our waiter did struggle a bit to remember our order. Very neat and clean. Regardless, it was a fantastic experience and I will absolutely be back for another delicious meal. Totally worth the price in my opinion!

I have been to Armstrong's several times and have always had a tasty meal. The decor is old fashioned and nothing special but I think the food here is worth trying. I always get the penne a la vodka which is delicious. My husband has tried the sausage/meat casserole and wasnt impressed but he has tried several seafood items there including the scallops and crab stuffed shrimp which he did enjoy. Wedding soup is also very good and is a true Italian wedding soup! Large portions and fast service. They do get busy on the weekends and we have had to wait when with a big party. There is also a bar with a few TVs for anyone interested. They also have takeout. I will be back and highly recommend Armstrong's! Only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars is the really because of the atmosphere/decor.

I stand by my original review and do love Armstrong's! Service is very fast, people are friendly and the food delicious! My favorite is the penne a la vodka but the manicotti with the vodka sauce was delicious too! 

The interior could use some updates but I can live with that if the food is good!

Aldis is different than usual grocery stores. Some name brand products but mostly Aldis's brand. Prices are incredibly reasonable for most items and they have al sections including produce, freezer, refrigerator, etc. 

You need a quarter for a cart and you must return the cart to get your quarter back. 
You also must bag your own groceries. 

I won't get all of my groceries here but certain items at definitely worth making a trip to save money which really adds up!

What an amazing place - a dormant volcano which you can walk to the top and feel like a superman! 

We started the climb from the bottom nearby car park at 630am and it only took us about 35 mins to reach the summit - there's a number of opportunities on the way to really check out the amazing scenery and of course getting great photo ops - especially the amazing sunrise! 

The only tough bit is the last few mins up to the summit but it's a fairly easy climb - it only took us 10 mins to walk back down! 

A great place to spend some time and what a great experience - check it out!

[Review for the Shop] [Hidden House review below]

I'm slightly bias as i have been going to "the Shop" for a few years now. Al Page kills it, KGB Kills IT, Soul man Kills It, Chris the Fist Kills IT!, every DJ i missed...well you sorta Kill it too. lol.

but the above mentioned can turn this place out.

now atmosphere. lets just say, house party. i think the maximum occupancy for Bruno Malli's is like 50 people. i have been nights where 300 people were there pumping there firsts. 
i have also been there nights and it was so dead that there was 6 people until midnight rolled around, and then all of a sudden the jail doors ripped open and there was a hundred drunk fools dancing.

drinks, yeah they be cheep. bartenders, yeah sometimes you get skipped over. shit i know they names and I'm yelling at them and they still don't hear me. Stacey, Katy.. still love ya. always poor my drinks right..so I'm not talkin shit.

Cash Only...yea that hurt me because i hate having to be packin cash. 40 bucks and by the time you and your friends are in the door and got a drink in your hand you start to question. how cheep are these drinks again?

smoking outside sucks but at least your not alone, there are always like 30 people outside smoking. some people say there is no mingling inside. well everyone is outside mingling over their camels' and Marlboro Reds'

bathroom, umm ladies only on this side (yeah right) so guys have to walk over to the Hidden House side. i've seen cleaner bathrooms in beiruit. i quickly get in and get the fuck out. don't touch anything. sink is optional, but sometimes it looks worse then the toilet.

figure i'll spill some vodka on my hands and call them clean.

ok back to the beats. Al spins Oldschool, and neo-soul for the most part and his hand selected dj's follow suit. you can expect to hear anything from Hierogplyics, to the Jackson 5. shit is eclectic for sure. don't expect to hear any of the current club bangers or Crunk Juice music, and especially no Hyphy go dumb music. meh.  i did get KGB to play some e-40 once. lol. anyways. 

come out and have some fun. 

[Hidden House]

i don't know what hidden house is really. not a dive bar, too bright.
not a sports bar, not enough tvs. not a restaurant, yes it has food.

its kinda  neighborhood spot. expect txhold'm tournements, pool huslting, network jukebox, large horseshoe bar, tables and booths, missing waitress.

for a bar i give it 3 stars, way too bright. but the booze is still cheap.

did someone say blue moon on tap? yeah. can't go wrong there. the service staff is nice. 

i have been stinking drunk on this side more then a few times, and have puked outside the bathroom...yea i'm not ashamed. it happened. don't act like you've never puked somewhere in public. all in all i still return. not as often as before and i normally stick to the Shop side.

Mi Patio is one of those restuants i really do not like. and i cannot understand why people do. the food isn't very good, and the margaritas are just as bad. i've been to Mi Patio as a kid and i remember it being a bit better, but as a kid i don't think you truely understand the different between good and bad. it is what it is and you enjoy it because it's different. as an adult. i'm paying for this shit. and it's regretful. i will not lie, i'll eat here on someone elses dime. but i'll save my shillings for something a wee bit better...like macyo's lol.

This place will never let you down! Wow! They really do have the wow factor here. From being greeted when you walk in, to great service, exceptional food and drinks and a "thank you" on the way out. The customer service sets this business apart from all the rest. Yesterday, 11/11/14, one of many visits, we had warm, fresh baked sourdough bread, creamy lobster bisque, the perfectly salty artichoke dip and the chicken and bacon panini. Everything was phenomenal and came out perfectly timed! We shared the white peach sangria and it was crisp, sweet and refreshing. Our sever was a tall male with short brownish blonde hair and he split all of our portions in two for us! What an above and beyond task. Thank you Brio for always making us happy and full!

Same Regency Cleaners staff and locations,  just new business name, ownership with more focus placed on a more environment friendly product and more current style.  No price changes.  Great chance to catch up with manager to get an idea whats going on, how the change affects us as customers, and get the low down on the product used.

Hoping to see an improvement from previous ownership.  I know the staff makes great efforts to provide customer care and service.  In the past I watched some good employees walk away and I am certain it was because of upper management aka previous owners.

Mmm Cracker Barrel.  Home style food without the work, dirty dishes, hot kitchen, setting the table, spilled milk, or arguments over the dinner table.  
Okay, it's sorta like that.
I seriously like the biscuits here -the cornbread, not so much cuz I can make it 10 times better.  
Favorite entree here is the chicken n dumplins.  Mmm mmm MMM!
Grits - good
Collard greens - good
Dumplins - really good
Chicken in the chicken n dumplins -  s'alright.
The chicken is clearly cooked separately from the dumplins and it's apparent in the flavor and appearance.  

Overall, still a reliable restaurant with consistently good, down to earth, Mom & Pop, home style cookin'.
And the service is generally alright too.

Also the family favorite for take-out.

Lowe's knocked my socks off today.  Like a typical lady, I'm not a huge fan of hardware stores (well, there ok for days when I feel like scoping for dudes). 

After my visit today, I realized something:  I went in and out of Lowe's to get the item I needed to purchase, a copy of a key, and paid without even talking to a person! :) 

Did you know that you can make a copy of a key with a kiosk now?!?!  It's quick, easy, and costs less than $2.00...pooofff!  My mind was blown.  Next, I set out to find the item I needed to purchase (nail hole wall repair) and found it quickly.  I then paid with self-checkout.  No need to talk to a person....

I kind of like this painless and antisocial way of shopping at a hardware store! hahahaha!

This is a great show. Be sure to arrive up to an hour early.  Jazz pianist Mike Jones and bassist Penn jam off to the side of the stage before the start of the show.  Audience members are invited on stage to inspect a wooden crate and sign their names to an envelope that is used later in the show.  The show itself is very entertaining.  Years ago Penn used to drop a bunch of f-bombs, but he now keeps it clean.  My 11 and 16 year old really enjoyed the show.  It is probably appropriate for kids 10 and above. 
      In 1985 I walked into a Radio Shack. Playing on a few of the television screens in the store was a new magic act that I'd never seen before. Their performance was edgy, smart and funny. I stood there in the store transfixed by what I saw. These guys were presenting magic in a new way.  When the show ended I resolved to remember their names.  I have been following their career ever since. I first saw them live in the mid-1990s.  I was surprised at then end of the show when they ran into the theater lobby and mingled with the departing audience and signed autographs. They clearly like people. They continue this tradition today, only now they will pose for selfies.

1) Awesome ambiance 
2) great location downtown
3) awesome Broadway show line ups!

Talk about a gorgeous venue! The ambiance of Overture is sophisticated and its the perfect venue to catch a play or Broadway show in Madison. Located right on State Street, the Overture Center is conveniently located near many great restaurants to grab dinner before or after the show!

Overture always has an awesome line up of Broadway shows! I just saw Newsies there which was INCREDIBLE! The 2015/2016 season includes Wicked, Kinky Boots, MoTown and Lion KIng. Definitely not a season you want to miss! 

Beverage stands are located in several places on all the floors. A glass of wine costs $8 but once you have the plastic souvenir cup you get $1 off of each beverage. You can bring it back the next time you go too. Woo!

The staff is super nice and helpful. Always a great night at Overture!

As a travel agent, I was completely appalled at how they handled one of my clients booking for a Grand Canyon Tour.  Firstly they couldn't find his reservation that I had made when he called to reconfirm 24hrs prior.  After I called and gave a little bit of hell- the agent proceeded to tell me the tour was booked for the date that I booked my client on and that he would have to change his dates! Hello! My client was only in Vegas for 2 nights!
All and all, after going back with Showtime tours, the agent there pretty much told me the tours were cancelled and my client was screwed SO I told them to cancel and process a refund, in which the agent said "FINE" and hung up on me...
Needless to say, teh next 4 Grand Canyon Tours I've booked all have gone to another local company...

I would give them ZERO stars if I could but STAY away from Showtime Tours they are not worth the time...

Paletas Betty has one of the best desserts I have found in the Phoenix area. The paletas are made with fresh fruit and nuts. They taste amazing. 

We tried the pineapple and the pecan flavors. The pineapple was an explosion of fresh fruit flavor. The pecan had a rich, milky flavor that was accented nicely with the nuts. I recommend both flavors.

The person working in the shop was extremely courteous and knowledgeable. He explained all about the store and how the various paletas are made. He also answered our questions.

I will definitely be back to try more paletas and I hope that this shop thrives for a long time to come.

Updated top flavor list:

1. Pecan - superbly roasted pecans in a milky, creamy paleta; this is the best one; we get it every time, in addition to trying new flavors
2. Pineapple - fresh, explosive flavor with real chunks of pineapple
3. Banana - fresh, sweet flavor with real chunks of banana; 
4. Pineapple Chili - Like pineapple, but sweeter and with a slight hint of pepper
5. Lemon Drop - extremely tart, with sugar on the outside; not for everyone, but great if you like a sour snack
6. Rice Pudding - the cinnamon is strong, so good if that is your flavor

See my original review for details on the overall experience.

5. Pear cranberry - light Lear flavor with tart whole fresh cranberries
6. Raspberry yogurt - slightly tart raspberry layer atop a very sweet raspberry yogurt layer
7. Lemon Drop - extremely tart, with sugar on the outside; not for everyone, but great if you like a sour snack
8. Pasa - amaretto almond base with especially tasty homemade dried grape raisins   
9. Banana with Caramel and Rum - much sweeter than the regular banana with hints of caramel and rum
10. Mexican Hot Chocolate - spicy chocolate flavor with some cinnamon
11. Rice Pudding - the cinnamon is strong, so good if that is your flavor

Updated top flavor list:

1. Pecan - superbly roasted pecans in a milky, creamy paleta; this is the best one; we get it every time, in addition to trying new flavors
2. Pineapple - fresh, sweet, explosive flavor with real chunks of pineapple
3. Banana - fresh, sweet flavor with real chunks of banana
4. Pear Cranberry - light pear flavor with tart whole fresh cranberries
5. Raspberry Yogurt - slightly tart raspberry layer atop a very sweet raspberry yogurt layer
6. Pineapple Chili - Like pineapple, but with a hint of spicy pepper
7. Lemon Drop - extremely tart, with sugar on the outside; not for everyone, but great if you like a sour snack
8. Pasa - amaretto almond base with especially tasty homemade dried grape raisins   
9. Blackberry Lavender - fresh fruit taste with strong lavender flavor
10. Banana with Caramel and Rum - much sweeter than the regular banana with hints of caramel and rum
11. Mexican Hot Chocolate - spicy chocolate flavor with some cinnamon
12. Rice Pudding - the cinnamon is strong, so good if that is your flavor

Another great option is the aquitas drink. The lime and raspberry flavor is an excellent mixture of seltzer limeade and fresh raspberry. It really packs a tart punch and strong flavors.

Really wish I read the reviews before signing up for this service. The driver who drove us to our hotel was extremely rude and arrogant. Dealing with him is not the way we wanted to start our vacation. We didn't even take the voucher for the ride back at the airport because he was so rude. I would much rather pay for a cab and give them a good tip than ever deal with this company again!!

Waited in line for about 15 minutes on Saturday morning before we got to the cashier for possibly the best brunch this trip. Once we paid, we were offered the choice to sit at the bar or wait to be seated. Time was a factor this morning as we had spa appointment in the Mirage Spa. 
Choose bar seating and it was outstanding, free running mimosas ( what a great way to start the day). I'm sure because we were at the bar I drank more than if I was at the table. 
International food stations throughout the space, very we'll signed so you can see the selection from across the room. I stayed close to the bar for Chinese assortments of dumplings, dim sum and wonderful noodle wonton soup !! All with your favourite sauces. As well as assorted sushi and hand rolls, rice dishes and the usual suspects with a bit of a twist.   Tried some shrimp ceviche and it was outstanding. My dinning companion had the breakfast burrito, Eggs Benedict & rosti.  The stations were incredable, and upon leaving saw other types of cuisines I would have liked to have tried,  we were to rushed to thoroughly enjoy the

Titanic exhibit was just fantastic,  if you check in on yelp the audio tour was also offered !! 
Just outstanding exhibit, from the boarding pass you receive at the beginning to the artifacts you see and all the information you gain throughout the tour! 

10 out of 10 !! 

The Luxor building itself is pretty cool from an engineering perspective, just awesome to look at inside and out. Did not stay here, so no comment on hotel.

Mark is incredible, and was the best choice when it came to getting a property manager. He seriously did everything! Got the renters, got their deposits, drafted forms, filed licenses, showed the property, listed it for sale to investors, and as requested, sold it for us!! We are so incredibly happy to have met him and had the opportunity to work with him.

The website is great and the auto-deposit of rent is flawless. He's incredibly flexible and patient, and never gave us any headache whatsoever (despite the complexity of our situation).

Great guy, wonderful manager, and I'm proud to now call him a friend. Thanks, Mark!!!

The bf and I came here around lunch time and the place was packed!
Not even a minute we came in we were called to our seats while there were several people waiting to be seated before us. 

Our server introduced herself to us and she just didn't seem like she wanted to be here but she did deliver.

I went to the restroom to wash my hands and this is the first time I've ever seen a worker in uniform using her phone with her planner out in the restroom.

The managers stuck out like a sore thumb in the crowd.

Anyways I ordered the $10.29 breakfast sampler came with 2 eggs, 2 sausage links,  and the bf ordered the special ultimate combo breakfast for $7.99 which was a tiny bit different but practically the same.

Server was nice and checked up on us to see how were doing which was nice after she saw that I was disappointed.  I explained to her that my order is practically the same as his but more expensive which I didn't understand.  She said the orders are not the same and that it is better to order from the specials which was the best advise she can give me.  

My best advise for the servers here are to suggest a special for a customer as an alternative for a better deal to get a better tip.

The food was good, but I could have gotten a better deal if I would have known.  

Now I know.

I only had the sushi here, but want to try the noodle bar and some other things next time. 

The sushi bar, was really good! They have some made and boxed up for you to take to go or you can sit at the sushi bar or any table and order as well. The sushi was fresh, a lot better than some places I've been too! I will definitely be back. A better alternative to bad eating on vacation.

They have a coffee shop and sandwich shop too. The coffee shop has amazing pastries!

Only 4 weeks old and a brand new building including a drive through. This is one of the largest Starbucks I've visited. What a difference compared to the original location in Seattle which opened in 1971

The driveways from Howard Hughes weren't paved yet it's so new. The service was solid and selection of coffee and brew paraphernalia was impressive. 

This will be a regular stop when I'm in town!

This update is long overdue. I've been visiting this location when I come into town for business or pleasure which is at least once a month.

I usually arrive in the am and the staff here is what make this location so unique and special. Daily customers which I've met two - get their coffee brought to them in regular coffee cups! The staff knows their clients so well they are preparing their orders before they reach the counter. This location also offers the Starbucks Reserve products and has a clover machine for preparation of one cup of reserve at a time!

Thank you to entire staff at this location for your outstanding service & quality!

Stayed here for the second time this weekend, and the hotel is a disaster. Service at Guest services is dreadful, from your room, it takes more than 6 minutes for anyone at the front desk to answer a phone.  most of the building is under construction, switching from TheHotel to Delano and all of the grounds are limited since construction is underway. The floors where rooms are located smell like heavy cigarettes, and the overall staff (with the exception of housekeeping which was phenomenally helpful) was unhelpful. Amenities in this building were not available, and we had to use those in Mandalay Bay which although connected, was very far away.

I would easily say that we received the most amazing service from the most incredible server in the world.  I only wished  i lived in Vegas to get the chance to have brunch here at least once/week.  the banana nut muffin was very fresh. The Chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes were perfectly fluffy and pumpkin was fresh, and teh chocolate chips were just right (not too much, not to few).  The Fried chicken skillet was also AMAZING!. Cooked just right, with a thick and creamy gravy, with perfectly cooked potatoes, and an egg, just how i asked for it. even the OJ carafe tasted fresh, and it probably wasn't though, but it had me fooled.
Again the prices, service and quality of food were amazing. (only thing is that this particular Egg&I restaurant was a bit far from our Hotel on the strip, but definitely worth the cab ride). Even the General Manager came by our table  a few times to ask how everything was. (my receipt says the  server is Mandy but i believe her real name was thiereny (shes getting married soon)).
And they have an amazing GIVEAWAY trip to Disney

This is my go to casino and hotel in Vegas. I love the fact that they don't just have a pool...they have an entire beach. My family loves to spend our summer here enjoying the wave pool and the lazy river. 

For the wave pool you need to meet a certain hight requirement. I believe it is around 48 inches but don't quote me on that. I know my kindergarten son does not meet it yet, but my ten year old has for a few years. 

The lazy river is great because you can bring your own tube. Don't try to bring a huge lounge float. That just isn't going to pass. If you buy a tube they are about 20 dollars. 

The hotel is amazing. It is so clean and everything smells like vanilla and coconut. I love it. The suites are what I stay in because I like having a separate sleeping area. Having a bedroom door makes me feel at home. I enjoy two rooms. 

I never see the old scummy people gambling here. It's higher class of people.

The hotel is connected to the Mandalay bay. Just don't confuse the check in because they have separate check in and valet parking. Everything else is connected. 

The rooms here are different than the rooms at Mandalay bay. I recommend both. The benefit of the hotel is that it is pet friendly.

My awesome FPIC brought me here and it didn't sadden my taste buds. This place is great with their health options of wraps and vegetarian options. 

The place is nice and opened with a lot of natural light. It is welcoming and clean.

The fillings are abundant and they definitely made it packed with fresh goodness! I almost didn't finish it and originally when they were building my wrap,  I thought it was not enough but when I ate it.....I realized how much they put into the wrap. The sauce is really flavorful and so was the wrap itself! My FPIC had the chicken bowl and it was enjoyed quite a bit, so much so that there was no offering to share. 

I will be back for more the next time I am there!

How many times have I come to Montreal and NOT eaten here???  This place is amazing!!!  

Fish of the day for two: perfectly cooked white fish in a butter wine sauce with roe mixed in, served with a side of clams and little potatoes.  

Horse filet mignon (unreal), tender, cooked medium rare, it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  

Duck dish topped with a piece of foie gras.  This came with a side of vegetable but I cannot recall at this point.

We also got a side of fries with a dipping sauce.  Yummy!

Even the soft serve was a refreshing end to a most decadent meal.  

Everything was fantastic.  I would come back here in an instant.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone!

I loved everything about this restaurant.  The food, the service... it was the highlight of my weekend!

Not sure where to post about the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Pool Complex when you're not actually talking specifically about Rehab, which is what you hear about the most so I'll post this here and on the page for the hotel.  But, the coolest thing about the Hard Rock Hotel Pool Complex is that during the week, you can use the pools for FREE!  Yup, I said free!

When we walked in there wasn't anyone around to direct us or check us or anything, so we just grabbed some towels and started wandering to see where we wanted to hang out.  The first thing we saw was the Rehab pool area and there was a DJ booth set up, the big pool and then a bar and swim up gaming that was not being used while we were there.  The pool continued on the other side and around the bar and on that side, there was a water slide.  I was happy about that as I love waterslides!  We wandered until we found a spot that had a little sun, but plenty of shade, too as the husband likes to stay in the shade.  We got settled in and after a little while decided it was time to take a dip. OH HELL NO!  The pool was so freaking cold I could not stay in it... we headed to the Jacuzzi to warm up and I knew there was no way I was hitting THAT waterslide.  The water was like ice water.  That would explain why so few people were in it.  I was pretty bummed, but we went back toour lounge chairs and did some reading.  Oh, by the way, near the DJ side of the pool there are VERY few chairs... if you want to sit, you need to rent the daybeds, etc. that are available, but as you head to the other side, you will find some chairs, but not many!

After we'd been there a couple of hours, we decided to go try the little pool near the top of the waterslide to see if it was warmer (it wasn't) and then we saw a sign for another pool, so started exploring.  What we found were more cabanas that are above the DJ area and another pool, Breathe.  Unfortunately, Breathe was closed so we couldn't even see it, but then we noticed just around another corner was the Nirvana pool and thank you, this one was warm enough to swim in and there was a pool near the bar that was seriously warm.  We picked up our gear and headed over to Nirvana, aptly named at this point.

Nirvana has a sandy beach on one side and the other side is your standard tile pool.  It is also surrounded by cabanas and there is a bar with some bar games and it looks like they do swim up gaming when they are busier.

It's unfortunate that the other pools are so freezing, but its nice to know that there was still a pool that is swimmable.  I just wish we'd discovered it earlier in the day!

I loved the layout and the landscaping of the Hard Rock pools.  The option for non-guests to visit for free during the week is AWESOME, but I think they make up for it with the outrageous drink prices, so we stuck to the free ice water they set out.  I just can't drop $20 on a 12oz drink.  YIKES!

I definitely recommend you check this out when you're pool hopping Vegas like we do in the summer and we will totally be back if they do this next summer!

I haven't stayed at the Hard Rock, but I hope to one of these days.  

What I love about the property is the memorabilia everywhere.  We're big fans of Hard Rock Cafes and visit them all over the world.  I LOVE the cool artifacts (rockifacts) you can find and this location does NOT disappoint.  What I was really digging was the awesome T-Shit collection.  SO COOL!  I don't get over there so often as we tend to walk while in Vegas and HRH is a bit of  a ways away from the strip, but we had a great time exploring and are considering spending a weekend there some time.  Maybe that will kick it up to a 5 star.  I'm DYING to hang in the pool! 

Another awesome Vegas Hotel and Hard Rock Property.

i love thai bbq. been eating at the ones in LA since i was a kid... not as good as LA, but it is pretty much the same. I get the chicken and rice... 

It comes with their classic sweet & sour sauce & red rice. its the shit!
i also get the beef bbq. super good... dip it in the same sauce... i think you can get it as a combo with the two meats.

highly recommended.

this place is expensive and not even good. its really busy, but i prefer not to eat at this place. because of the price... for 3 people it came out to like 48 dollars or something? WTH? 

No Way... Thirty something i could have dealt with but 48? I kno that wasnt worth $48!

Portions are small. The food isnt BAD... BUT NOT WORTH IT!!!!!

Located inside the Quad or Old Imperial Palace or Future Linq. Second floor entrance off a set of elevators of its own near the center of the Casino.

Tips: Come hungry and leave full as portions are country sized. Order a drink as the water is disgusting. 

Service and wait staff was friendly and not  prompt. We arrived early and seated before the breakfast rush. Food order was taken. Drinks refills for water and coffee came upon requesting.

Tried one of the skillets. Skillet was warm, moist, flavorful seasoned, and delicious. Toast was burnt. Dishes are accented with wheat, sage, or various farm fair. Presentation is something to enjoy in it's own. 

Coffee was decent not stellar.

Overall three stars. Good food and drink presentation. Service quality was not great nor bad. Willing to come back with an appetite.

This dice bar is hard to find tucked behind a convenience store on east Thomas. The parking is behind the bar so you won't notice its a business so easily. Want you will notice is they don't give a $#it. 

You'll also find great prices on drinks and a large and unique draft selection. The people that come are friendly as is the staff

Movies play on the small TVs and you can bring food in from carry outs or I suppose from your home if you felt like it because no food is served here. There is a pool table outdoor area and and decent seating capacity 

Once you have found it you'll become a regular

Yes, it's a chain. You wouldn't know it, though, except that the ceiling tiles are screen printed instead of hand painted with winged biscuits and other such culinary literalisms. For some reason, that element makes the Charlotte locations smell of franchise. Otherwise, the interiors do a decent job pushing the pretense that the restaurant is in a converted bungalow near those of the original Biscuit in Atlanta's Candler Park, or that it is a hometown diner that has been there for years instead of doing business in Charlotte's newer and oldest shopping centers.

Lines form on weekend mornings with people salivating over the breakfast served all day on Fiestaware, especially the biscuits sprinkled with sugar and served with homemade cranberry apple butter. And those grits. Those creamy, dreamy grits that made this lifelong grits detester see the light at the end of the hominyless tunnel. Grits can and should be made with heavy cream. If they aren't, they aren't worth eating.

Lunch and dinner options are as tasty as those from the breakfast all day menu; many are altered with eggs or the lack thereof to make them appropriate for the time of day. Case in point: Egg-Ceptional Eggs and Love Cakes, both of which are in the Top Five Favorites dishes of this writer. Daily specials are posted on the boards outside, and are usually worth a try. Menu substitutions are easy, and so is the staff, which in general is pleasantly attentive.

Though it is not a Charlotte original, we'll claim it as our own, if only for those devilishly alluring grits.

This place is crazy. There is a line for each meat. So don't be confused when you walk in and see 4 separate lines, they are different and you wait on each for different tacos. The pork was a crowd favorite and my personal favorite as well. So good and authentic feeling. This place was a nice change of pace from other food in Vegas. I've been visiting family here for years and wish I found this spot sooner.

Come tax season, he is always my go-to guy. I've sent everyone in my family to him as well. I love his service! He does everything he can to give you the best and most for your tax return. He's also taken the extra mile to help my Dad with setting up his personal business. He's such a great accountant, and I've been going to use his services every year for a few years now.

He now does real estate, and is always willing to help you and give you advice and direction if you need it. 

Thanks Ivanno!

I need to write another review because his service is so amazing that he merits an update. I'm not a commitment type of person when it comes to services, but I feel that I've found my accountant soulmate with Ivanno. So it's hard for me to go elsewhere. Even with TurboTax service, I feel it's well worth the effort to just go to his office. I've gone here for years (4 or 5).

He's very TRANSPARENT as an accountant and when it comes to managing your taxes or finances every year, it's important to have that transparency.
Ivanno will break everything down for you. My Dad is in an independent contractor so Ivanno explains to my Dad what he needs to do, what Ivanno will be doing, and why. He'll explain what the IRS maybe looking for and will also tell you what you may expect based on current news. He maximizes your returns in the best, most professional, and most trusting way possible. 

He'll breakdown and explain basic accounting knowledge to you in the best way for you to understand. I think that is an added value in any service. Knowledge is free! So take what you learn from him and even if you don't become a regular, I promise you'll gain something out there it that you can apply in any accounting service. You'll leave know the right questions to ask.

Lastly, he's a very down to earth person so you can feel comfortable asking and talking to him about anything. You won't feel pressured, ashamed, or doubtful about the questions you ask. Super humbling guy.

Some restaurants will always hold a special place in your heart - or should I say arteries. Momma's is not an experience to be missed, whether you're a native of Montreal or just visiting. It is part of the reason why many students pack on the Freshman 20, Boreal beer not-withstanding. Located in the Latin quarter, Momma's Pizzeria is open until 3 a.m. and you can get burgers, steak subs, eggs and bacon or poutine. When I was a student at McGill, if you got 2 orders of poutine for take-out you got a third for free, so we were always trying to rally a third person at Closing time to feast at Momma's with us. This place has been around for over four decades now, and if any of my friends are heading out to Montreal I tell them to stop here. It's just part of the Montreal experience you don't want to miss. Montreal gave me a horrible addiction to poutine I'm afraid I'll never shake. Cheese, fries and gravy?! Who knew?!

I found the menu options a bit confusing with the Chef's Beef Selection Three Course Menus option. It turned out to be cheaper for everyone to order alacarte and get the beef of their choice. The food was prepared as ordered. The ribeye and salad was great.

I do so enjoy a great local craft brew, but they have none of that here, so I had to go to Angels Trumpet instead, booo.

As long as you're here though, you might just prop yourself up at the best craft cocktail bar in all of greater Phoenix. Rivaled by literally no one else in downtown, midtown, Scottsdale, the east valley and the west, the bartenders will craft you whatever your taste buds desire.

Menu, please, don't insult their knowledge of the darks, if that's what your into, but me, I usually stick to the lighter spirits. Go up to the bar, return the menu they might have just handed you, and tell them everything you love in a drink. Maybe it's the flavor of basil in a delicious gin drink. Perhaps it's passion fruit along side a tasty vodka. Maybe your flavor is tart, not sweet and with a kick of spice, or the best Manhattan you've ever had but you love them because the amazing orange flavors. Trust me, put down the menu and just tell em what you want out of a drink, you won't regret it, not for one second!

Oh, and if that flavor is beer, I do believe they have a couple taps, just don't expect anything crafty. 

If you're feeling like you're on the outside whenever you come in here, it's probably because you are. Let me tell you a secret, but shhhhh, don't tell anyone else. Ask for their "secret menu" for a list of drinks and food items only available to the inside crowd here. 

The ramen burger is delish, as is everything else I've tried here foodwise, but who exactly can remember everything I've had from the many visits to B&T?, certainly not I.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, I'm sure we'll run into each other at some point down the road, as long as your road brings you to B&T!


...Obligatory shout out to Jason, he's my favorite bartender, but watch out girls, he's taken. I asked him for a crafty spin on my go to Titos with lime and he knocked it out of the park; it was tart, not sweet, effervescent, bubbly, and delicious, and I order it just about every time I'm there! :-)

This place is a nice upscale, decently authentic Thai restaurant in Chinatown.  I had the Crab Rangoon, the duck curry, and some Thai Iced tea.   Overall I wasn't overly impressed, but I could see bringing friends or a date to this place.   

The Crab Rangoon was very sweet.  The sauce reminded me of pomegranate jelly. Not bad, but definitely not the best.  Way too sweet in my book.  The Thai tea was alright, but it tasted a little cheap or perhaps with artificial sweeteners.

The duck curry (red curry) was the best part of the meal.  It was actually quite tasty.  This dish had a surprising mixture of green and red peppers, tiny chopped carrots, peas, fresh pineapple chunks, and raisins.  The red curry itself was satisfactory in taste, and had a watery texture that soaked well into the white rice.  It was served with the perfect level of spice (I asked for medium), and it was not too sweet.  Not a bad dish at all.

I didn't have any problems with the service, which I've noticed in a few reviews.  The place was mostly staffed by younger Asians, and they were having a good time while working, so maybe there are nights when the staff get carried away... I dunno.  The atmosphere was very classy though, with jazz music in the background.  I probably won't go back on my own again, but like I said earlier, this would be a nice place to take a date.

My review:

Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.  

The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.

Today I began with a large bowl (enough for 4!) of chicken corn chowder.  I found it to be slightly bland.  Next was sweet and sour chicken and house fried rice.  Both good.

I was disappointed that they did not offer combination plates.  Everything was ala carte (Sat).

Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!

Looking for big portions?  

Looking for an inexpensive meal?

Don't mind going to a hole in the wall, no swank place?

Wong's is for you!

I had the shrimp & lobster sauce lunch combo.  It came with egg drop soup.  The style of cooking is a little different than what I am used to from places in the metro NYC area.  The lobster sauce was brown and not white.  Overall it was ok.

My lunch mate ordered orange chicken.  I tried a piece and it was outstanding! 

Bottom line:  I will return.  Don't be scared off by the look of the place. Friendly staff and good food at a great price.  Give it a try!

2 times here in 2 weeks.

Lots of fun last week.  Great comics, great service (Chris was my server) and great drinks.

Tonight I am having dinner here.  They just changed food providers to Sugar Rae's.  I have no info on this company but we'll see!

They have a larger selection of BBQ.  They also offer 3 salads and 3 flatbread options.  They have a variety of typical BBQ joint sides:  baked beans, Mac & cheese, cole slaw......

I ordered the 3 meat plate with pork, brisket and a hot link.  My sides are baked beans and Mac & cheese.

Food is good.  Chris was my server again so service was also good!

I have been to Stand Up Scottsdale many, many times.  The comics here are always funny with a variety of entertainment styles.  The owner, Howard Hughes even has a stand up routine that entertains the crowd!

The food is from Sugar Rae's BBQ kitchen.  While they offer more than just BBQ I have to admit that I always seem to gravitate towards the BBQ because it is tasty.

The drinks are good and at an affordable price.

The staff is attentive and provides good service.

I recommend you stop in for a show and be prepared to laugh your ass off!

My review:

Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.  

The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.

Tonight I had the medium wings.  Yum!

Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!

Friendly - yes
Efficient - yes
Positive experience -yes

Note:  they allow walk-ins for X-rays and possibly other tests so that may be the cause of several poor reviews.

Famous Dave's is always good when nothing else sounds good.  It isn't super fancy or special, but it gets the job done when you want some traditional American BBQ quick!

The menu is diverse and has a lot of American favorites on the menu from BBQ beef, pork, and chicken, burgers, fish options, and even salads.  My favorite items are the BBQ pulled pork and the catfish fingers.  YUMMY! I will almost always get one or the other almost every time I visit a Famous Dave's.  Hey, I know what I like!  They also have some great side items to add to your meal.  The spicy mac n' cheese is quite a highlight and delightful, if I do say so.

I also have to give props to Famous Dave's because they have Sweet Tea!  It is so hard to find Sweet Tea out West, so whenever I do, I am all over it like white on rice.  I love me some Sweet Tea!  Yummy!

Overall, the food here is good, the service is good, and the price is low.  If you just can't decide what you want to eat, you know you can find something good at Famous Dave's.

I have been to Hash House several times over the years, usually when friends are in town.  I only go when my group of friends want to go.  It really isn't one of my go to places.  I like the food, but I don't think it is super special.  

Yes, you get huge servings and will almost always have leftovers to bring home, which is a plus, but not enough to make me a diehard HH fan.  My complaint would be that the food doesn't have a ton of flavor.  I have had a lot of different items that always sound good, look beautiful, and have great presentation, but almost always the food is lacking flavor.  Everything is bland to me.  I always have to add a ton of salt, pepper, hot sauce, syrup, or something to add some flavor.  I love chicken and waffles in general, but the chicken here is always lacking seasoning. I do think the Kokomo sandwich is quite tasty though!

I will probably keep ending up at HH occasionally because so many friends are in love with this place.  I will keep giving it a chance when I am there because I like the concept and the idea of the place.  And like I said, I think it is ok, just nothing amazing.

First up, I have never used a storage unit at this location before, but I have used this facility to rent a U-Haul truck and purchase moving supplies a couple times now.  I used them a long time ago when I moved into my current house and had a great experience.  It was prior to my Yelping days, so sorry for the late review!  

We are going to be moving again soon, so I have been down there a couple of times buying boxes and moving stuff.  The people I have encountered so far are friendly and helpful.  The gentleman working today, even loaded my trunk up with all of the boxes I had purchased.  It's always nice when a company goes that extra step to help their customers out.  

I would definitely recommend this place for your moving supplies.  They people are super nice, so I am sure their entire business is run in the same fashion.

Eyebrows R Us is a threading salon.  They specialize in eyebrows, but do all of the body in their salons.  I have only used them for eyebrows, so my review is based on that service specifically.  And yes, it does hurt!  Oh, the things girls go through....

I have been going off and on to Eyebrows R Us for several years now.  I started going when they only had 1 store in the valley and have stuck with them through the years, on and off. I don't live super close, so I only visit a ERU if I am near one on another errand, otherwise I just wax my eyebrows at my local nail place.  I have been to several of their locations and service seems to be the same across the board. So good points for being consistent on eyebrows!  They always do a good job and I am always pleased with the look of my brows afterwards.  

The prices are also pretty good at $10 or you can get prepaid cards for discounted services if you plan on visiting regularly.  The cards don't expire, so even if you don't go regularly, but every now and then, the card is still worth it. They also offer very reasonably priced unlimited programs for a month, 6 months, and up to a year.  

The reason I am giving them a 3 star rating is the customer service portion.  No one ever seems to be smiling and or happy whenever I am there.  I get everyone has bad days, but every single time and not one person is smiling.....Weird!  No one is ever very welcoming or pleasant when you talk to them.  They always just tell you to sign in and they usually just point to you when it is your turn.  If it is your first time, they also seem a little annoyed during the threading if you don't know how to hold your eyebrow during the session.  I don't think I have ever had more than a 2 sentence conversation with anyone at any of their locations.  So if you want friendly people, don't come here.  If you don't mind, then go for it, because they are good at eyebrows!

So there you have it.  Decide for yourself and good luck with your eyebrows!

I love this grocery store!  And I am incredibly sad that I know live on the other side of town from it.  I hope they build by me again, because the regular chain stores in Vegas just don't cut it.

First off, everyone is so friendly here.  You feel welcome and appreciated.  This is such a rare thing any more, that when you do get it, it is like sunshine on your face.

Secondly, the deli section!  They have the ready to eat meals waiting and looking delicious for you, the awesome selection of high quality meat and cheeses, and then all the fun stuff to catch your attention that you didn't need, but buy anyway because it looks so darn good.

Third, the prices are really good and the selection on everything is pretty big. It is like a neighborhood shop, but the size of Walmart.  It's a great place to shop at.

Go check it out and look at the weekly meal deals for some great deals on dinner packages!

This Albertson's is nice.  

I find this store to be quite expensive as compared to some of the other stores I have been to, so I don't visit this one very much.  They do have a free savings membership card you can get, which you should, that saves you some money.  Even with the membership card, the prices are still high, in my opinion.

This location is a large store with a lot of options when it comes to food, so that part is nice.  The deli is always well stocked with high quality sandwich meats and great cheese options.  I love me some good cheese.   They also offer a lot of handmade sides like egg, tuna, and chicken salads, cole slaw, ambrosia, amongst many others.  Whenever I get an egg salad craving I make a beeline to this store to get my fix ASAP.  Oh and the roast chicken here is divine!  The rosemary garlic flavor is delightful.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  

I do also have to say that the bakery at Albertson's make the best cakes in the valley.  I have had many cakes from lots of bakeries around town and I think the cakes at Albertson's are by far the yummiest! One of my favorites is the Victorian Lace cake with raspberry filling.  I have never seen it at any other bakery, which is a shame.  It is a beautiful cake and tastes even better! And yes, I have tried the big names like Freed's and I still think Albertson's has an edge on cakes.  What can I say, I LOVE cake!

This store also has a DIY USPS office inside.  This USPS location is rarely busy and you can get your stamps or mail packages quickly here.  They even keep it stocked with envelopes and boxes for you to use, if needed.  It is a great option to have and is much faster than the main post office for the area on Tenaya.  

This location also has a Starbucks inside of it.  Yep, you can get your caffeine fix and then power grocery shop.  Talk about efficient grocery shopping!

They also have a Silver State School Credit Union branch inside the store.  This is my bank, so I am here a lot to do my banking. It is easy to deposit your checks and then swing by to pick up a cake from the bakery.  YEAH!

So if you need to do a lot of stuff, come here and you can get your Starbucks, mail your packages, get a car loan, and restock your pantry.  Now that is a serious one stop shopping event!

Today was my first time at Labcorp and what an experience it was!

I went to Labcorp because it is who my doctor's office uses for their testing.  The nurse told me to make an appointment since they are usually quite busy, so I did.  The Labcorp website is easy to use and to make an appointment of your choosing.  You can even fill out the insurance info online, so you don't  have to do the paperwork upon arrival.  I love saving time! 

I arrived about 5 minutes early and was called back before I could even finish a round of CandyCrush on my phone.  The phlebotomist was professional and friendly.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  Yep the whole time spent in Labcorp was 10 minutes.  I couldn't believe it!

I hope my doctor always uses Labcorp because 10 minutes is about as long as I want to spent at an appointment.

So I am new to the Five Guys phenomenon and I am so excited to have seen the light!  

My husband and I found this place when we were trying to decide what to have for lunch one day.  We had heard people talk about it, but hadn't been by one when we wanted to eat.  I'm so glad we finally found one at lunch time though!

First let me tell you that I am a burger lover.  I am always trying to find great burgers wherever i  am.  When I was in Kenya a couple of years back, I almost died because there weren't burger places in the Safari-lands.  I went 3 weeks without a burger and almost died, I swear!  So whenever I find a great burger joint, it makes my day and I love to spread the word.

So we walked into the store and all you can smell is wonderful, meaty goodness.  I knew I mind was about to be blown and boy was it!  We walked up to order and that is when I saw the wall of options you can get on your burger for no extra charge.  You can go simple or crazy and everything is the same price.  I love condiments, so I was really happy with the extra options like A1, BBQ, and hot sauce.  Life needs spice, so might as well add it to the burger, huh?

We waited a few minutes for our burgers and that is when I saw the Coca-Cola machine of my dreams.  So many options to customize your drink.  I love soda, almost as much as burgers, so I was in heaven.  It was almost overwhelming to have so many options.  I was just happy that I was able to try out several different soda combinations during our visit.  I think I drank my entire month's allotment of soda during this one visit, but it was worth it baby!

And then the fun began because our burgers were ready.  The first bite of my delicious burger made me see stars, in a good way.  I even chewed slowly to make the moment last longer.  I had juices and sauces all over my face and running down my hands, but I was in love.  Sorry hubby, the burger may have bumped ahead of you on my love meter!

Now every burger needs some fries and the fires here do the job well!  They do a cute thing here by posting where the potatoes that your fries are made out of were grown.  It is fun to know such a little detail.  My fries came from Boise, ID, in case you were wondering.  We each got an order of the Five Guys Style and the Cajun flavor and loved both of them, but we only needed one order between the 2 of us.  I think one order would feed a small family, so keep that in mind when you order your fries.  They were great fries though.  You can tell that they are fresh cut and fried right away.  They were yummy and delightful.

Another thing I really liked was that they label each burger.  It is nice just to look for your burger # on the top of the burger, than having to open each lovely present to check and see if it is yours or not.  Great idea Five Guys!

So yes, I have a new burger place for when I am on the go.  I am lucky that one isn't too too close, otherwise I might end up being 500lbs.  If you haven't tried Five Guys, go do it now!

Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum!

Yeah, that about sums it up when it comes to Kathy's Southern Cooking.  

I was hanging out at my mom's and we wanted something different for lunch.  Enter Yelp and it's awesome suggestions, which is how we found out about Kathy's Southern Cooking.  After seeing the pictures of the food, I knew we had to get there right away!

We went for a lunch on a Saturday and were the only ones in the place.  At first I was a little worried because I was hoping we didn't make a mistake in going to Kathy's.  Then I got my glass of sweet tea and I knew we had made the right choice.  A great southern cooking place has to have great sweet tea, otherwise what's the point?  It turned out to be a treat to have the place to ourselves because 1. my toddler daughter wouldn't bother anyone, and 2. the lady working the counter (sadly, I can't remember her name) was a doll and we had so much fun chit-chatting with her through our time there.  She really made our experience great from her lovely personality and excellent service.

Now to the important part.....The food!  We are a southern family and wanted some of our go-to comfort foods, fried chicken and fried catfish.    The fried chicken was just like the chicken we used to get in Tennessee at my grandma's dinner table.  The catfish tasted like the catfish from Mississippi and my childhood.  My mom swears that the catfish is the best she has eaten outside of the South.  I can't argue with that statement because it was YUMMY.  

We also ordered the mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, red beans & rice, and fries as side items.  Everything was amazing! The highlights had to be the real mashed potatoes with gravy made to order and the gooey mac n' cheese.  Everything was good, but those were both REALLY good.

We finished our meal with Banana Pudding.  It was delicious!  My mom decided she is never making banana pudding again and will just order it from Kathy's from here on out.  I'm ok with that.  I just want my banana pudding please!

As time goes by this theater is being left behind.  This used to be one of AMC's best theaters.  This theater has not been modernized and is no longer one of their better locations.  Has anyone noticed that half the theaters here have been blocked off for many years now?  They are AMC Mesa Grand 24, but I think they now only have 14 working screens.  Location is very good, but this location could stand to be remodeled and upgraded.  The people who work here are helpful and friendly. The concession selection is good, but they should modernize like many of AMC's premium locations.  Plus not having IMAX here is a big reason why I don't come to this location very often any more. =|

I love going to see movies at AMC Theaters!  This is not one of their better locations.  This theater has not been upgraded to be modern like many other locations.  The parking here also sucks.  The parking lot is only comprised of compact car spaces.  Most vehicles have to double park to fit.  Location is good being just off of I-10.  I always have a good time here, but have been known to have great times at most other locations.  At least the people who work here are generally helpful and friendly. =|

The food here is awesome!  This Location is convenient off of US 60. I eat here often when seeing a movie next door at AMC Mesa Grand 24.  I wanted to give this location 5 stars, but could not because I have not always had good service.  The service quality depends on when you eat at this location.  Usually the service is fast & friendly, but if you come here when the high school kids are working, service usually is ok at best, if even that good.  Overall very good except for a couple of times of rude service from the teenagers.  I reported the rude teenagers to the manager on another visit and he said he would look into the situation.  Service lately has been excellent.

Okay, so this place is kind of great!  VIP has a very unique and maybe even a bit of an intimidating menu if one isn't adventurous.  With that said though, I am a huge fan of this place.  The menu is large with Chinese and Japanese options.  I have only tried the Chinese options and really think that VIP maybe the best Asian restaurant that I have been to.

On both visits I have been able to try many different items and a few items definitely stand out.  The cumin beef, seasoned with cumin of course and veggies is amazing!  I also tried the beef heel which are thinly sliced pieces in a chili sauce is also really great.  I have also loved the duck on both visits.  We also tried the fish, the exact type escapes me now but it is served scored with a chili sauce.  That dish was also very good.

Not only is the food good here though but the service as well.  Our waiter was very helpful and gave great recommendations.  VIP has a great drink menu as well.  I should also mention that this place is sort of deceiving from the outside.  I say that because upon walking in the atmosphere is that of a sort of upscale restaurant in a really big city.  This is a great place to host a large group or for date night.  My fiance and I were here a few days ago and we are really looking forward to going back!

Okay, so this place is kind of great!  VIP has a very unique and maybe even a bit of an intimidating menu if one isn't adventurous.  With that said though, I am a huge fan of this place.  The menu is large with Chinese and Japanese options.  I have only tried the Chinese options and really think that VIP may be the best Asian restaurant that I have been to in Madison.

At first glance, this is a great community. The dog parks and pools are the best part of this place. And thats where the greatness ends.

THE STAFF IS HORRIBLE!!!!! They do not return phone calls, and basically have their heads up their butts, because there is no communication between the corporate office and all their residences...

I heard good things about Mark Taylor Residences,which is why we looked at this place, but after living with them for over a year, 
I WILL NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND LIVING HERE. 
They overcharge for rent, and dont tell you when your rent is being raised. They also require a 60 day to-vacate notice, not a 30 day, and they dont tell you that either. READ THE FINE PRINT. Otherwise, you will get screwed. Oh, and make sure that you look at an apartment that you would actually be getting, because they show you the better one of the two. We got all old appliances and old carpet, but they showed us a nicer place, saying it was the same rent. When we went to move in, they said "oh you have to pay more for that one you looked at." Freaking idiots. Come to find out, our neighbor paid the same rent and had all those new things that we were excited about in the beginning. When we brought it up to a manager, we didn't receive a call back. Figures...

Even after moving out, we are still getting screwed. We had our address changed with the office, and even after going to the office a second time to make sure it was changed, they still didn't do it. My fiance's mail for the last month and a half has been being sent back to the post office, bills included. 

SO THANK YOU VERY LITTLE MARK TAYLOR RESIDENCES, FOR SCREWING OVER YOUR RESIDENTS! 

DO NOT MOVE IN HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So, I love my stylist but she didn't offer the trendy Brazilian Blowout.  I am rarely trendy but straight hair lacking frizz tempted me like the devil!  After researching the price throughout the area, I made an appointment.  Rina was so pleasant and so far I am very pleased with the service.  I will definitely return when I need a hair affair.

I had not visited the spa portion until this past weekend.  For a special occasion like someone visiting or a "day date", I would recommend this spa.  It is beautiful and the facilities are fantastic.  My massage was about a 7 out of 10.  My experience cost $160 with tip for 50 minutes.  If I just want a great massage I will continue to use Hand and Stone on Cactus for a third of the price.

Having been a vegetarian in the past, I always appreciate a place that caters to those who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet. Plus, who can resist the cakes and cookies they make which are vegan, no less? 

I ordered a chicken, spinach, and mushroom panini with pesto sauce to go. As I waited, I checked out their bakery display. The employees recommended the chocolate chip cookies. But for some reason, the cakes were calling out to me, so I chose the Vanilla Chocolate Chip Cake. Cookies next time :)

The employees were very nice and friendly, very helpful with the menu. Any items that contains meat, you can substitute a meatless version of it. They encourage you to inform them of any allergies you may have, and of course, if you're vegan OR vegetarian before you select what to eat. 

The decor is very modern and chic, with couple of TV's to watch. Very cute place to have a quick lunch, but quality food. It's not fast food, I definitely had to wait a few minutes to get my order. I took my food home, both the panini and cake were awesome. 

Definitely going back :)

I'm in the neighborhood, I look on Yelp, and Sunrise Coffee comes up. It's definitely a warm cozy coffee shop, offering organic coffees and loose leaf teas, plus organic breakfast burritos. It's definitely not your ordinary Starbucks. Thank goodness!

You sit there with your drink served in real coffee cups, your food is delivered on real plates. There's a big variety of coffee drinks to choose from, your favorite cafe latte or chai (brewed here, no powder). They offer all the regular milks, and also almond and rice milk. They suggested a new tea for me, Cherry Jubilee, which wasn't on the menu. Very fruitful, but tasty. I love that they provide Truvia sweetener. Big bonus point.

I also got a cinnamon raisin bagel, and their spreads... You can choose regular butter or cream cheese, however, they also offer vegan cream cheese, almond butter, organic strawberry jelly and peanut butter. I am one who very much enjoys these options! More brownie points.

Did I mention they have a drive-thru and free wifi? I'm glad I'll be living close by soon, I'll definitely be a regular :)

God, what a waste of calories.  

I don't remember how much we paid for this buffet.  I do remember it wasn't as pricey as the Bellagio buffet.  I'd say somewhere in the ball park of $25/pp on a weekend for brunch.

Don't waste that money.  Fork out the extra dough and head over to the Bellagio buffet.  

Everything here was poor quality.  Nothing was made fresh.  All the food is made long before it is served and stored in warmers.  It's either dry or flavorless when you get it.  There isn't much of a selection either. 

Last time I was here, I remember the chilaquiles being delicious.  This time, dry, dry, dry.  

I saw a cook cleaning up one of the food stations, because as is common at a buffet, we folk get messy and spill a few noodles or two over the edge.  Instead of wiping it up and throwing the mess away, he threw it back in the pan, only to be served up to someone who didn't see it happen.  Yes! Food that had been sitting on the edge where everyone puts their hands and plates. Oh man, that's gross.  

I guess this is the price I pay for indulging in the all too gluttonous Vegas buffet.  

On the plus side, the servers and hostesses were all very nice and efficient.

1 week later, my skin is still in shock, flaking, peeling.  I purchased the combined treament of a Signature Pumpkin Orange Peel and Micro-Derm Skin Spatula procedure. I guess I must have mis-read the details, because I thought I was going to get a Micro-Derm - you know? the kind that feels like sanblasting, but with crystals??  

Well, this was nothing like that!  Guess what?  my face was scraped with a surgical steel blade!  ya, i was pretty shocked, (and scared to move a muscle).  

The rest of the facial massage, creams, pumpkin peel, ect. was all fine.  

The 1st day or 2, my skin was pretty much on strike (normal for agravating the first 1 or 2 layers), but on the 3rd & 4th day, my face actualy had scratch marks on it, like I had been literally scratching my face with sharp nails.  

I have had many facials & micr-derms preciously, but never, ever had scrapes on my face, so much flaking, nor peeling.  I have been using serums, creams, lotions, and calming toners to try to settle and address all the trauma, but i guess it will just take so more time.

Nichole, (the owner), was very nice, and kudos to her for owning a business at such a young age, but I can't say that I have a desire to go back, and i definately could never reccomend a facial with a surgial blade to anyone.  I just wish i had the regular micro-derm I've had in the past, and with good results.

 FYI: I don't have sensitive skin, so this was fairly surprising to have experienced.

I should have known better, especially after I realized this aquarium was located "inside" AZ Mall.  I really felt sorry for the huge line of people standing outside, in the heat, for over an hour,and most with babies and toddlers.  (I was lucky to have obtained passes and was ushered inside immediately).  

First of all, don't even think about going for a few months until the crowds die down!!  It was horrible: having to wait to see each and every pool, pond, tank, and exhibit all the while surrounded by the crush of people, tiny kids running around your legs, 10 yr olds shoving past you, and tripping over dozens of strollers everywhere.  Even with all that mayhem, it still only took 1 hour to go through the entire place!!  It definitely would have made a big difference to have been about 60% less people, but 'd have to say in no way, shape or form is this worth $100 for a family of 4!!.  Even with my  1/2  price discount I can't say that even $50 did I get the feel it was worth it at all.  Maybe around $10 per adult would have made it palatable and only then would I recommend it.  

The kids are given little scratch off cards to take quizzes and trivia questions throughout.  They are 'suppose' to get a prize at the end.  Guess what? They had none left, even though we were done before noon!  (Should have at least offered something!)

Seriously, I would not go back, I don't think even if I obtained free passes.  What a big disappointment!  I thought that since they were somehow affiliated with LegoLand I would have expected MUCH more.

My husband and I have been working with some of the staff to plan a Vow Renewal to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We looked at several venues and this was my favorite. The Mansion is beautiful!  It has all of the original woodwork. You could stand and look for hours and still not see all of the intricate details. There is a huge fireplace in the foyer as well as a beautiful piano. The grand stair case is a great place to exchange vows or take photos. The windows are floor to ceiling stained glass. We were beyond thrilled to find out there was a small Chapel on the 2nd floor. We will be renewing our vows there and then having an intimate dinner in the dining room. 
The Mansion also serves as a Bed & Breakfast. We were hoping to stay overnight there but they were already booked to capacity for a wedding being held Saturday, the day after out Renewal. 
The staff and Chef are amazing. The menu to choose from is extensive. They offer valet services as well. Our experience has been top notch ever step of the way.

Last night was our event and it was beyond wonderful!!  Our guests "couldn't stop talk about how beautiful the mansion was and how incredibly delicious the food was. The chapel was perfect for our ceremony and the mansion was a great backdrop for photos.  A big THANK YOU to Shirley, Marissa, and the rest of the staff for making our event so special.

The place was clean and the employees were very friendly. Our food was served fairly quickly -- It was prepared fresh, so I didn't expect instantaneous service.

My son loved his quesadilla and said he wished he had ordered two. I had a carne asada burrito, which I found hot and tasty. Nothing terribly special, but definitely not bad. I think you'd really like their food if you love avocado -- I tasted a lot of that on both the taco and the burrito.

The el pastor taco I had was interesting. I found the flavor reminiscent of the BBQ pork you get at Chinese restaurants. It looked like the meat had the same pinkish ring and brightly-colored exterior glaze. The pineapple enhanced that flavor. Maybe it is just me. I may have to go back and order it again just to see if it was a fluke.

Now I haven't had the pleasure of actually going inside PIR yet....but I will be attending the race on March 3rd. When I come home from the race on that Sunday I will update this review....but let me tell you what I think of the place so far. The wife and I went out to Avondale to get a lay of the land this past weekend so I would not be running around like a chicken with my head cut off in March. I was surprised how dated the building look however I know they repaved the track a couple of years ago so I can't wait to see that. The parking is free and I know we will be sitting in the AJ Foyt section.....what does that mean....well I talked to a security guard and he provided me with some valuable information. Looks like we will parking near Gate 1 and then a shuttle will bring us over near Gate 5 where are seating section is located. There appears to be tons of parking but looks like we will have to get there really early to get a good close spot. It appears to be only one real road in out of the place would should be interesting....but I think I will have a great time none the less.

I am concerned about the seat cushion issue though because PIR has some strict rules. However I talked to a nice gentleman named Lyle and he is looking into the situation as we speak.....and he responded to my request in a timely fashion as well.....so KUDOS. So again I will update this review after I attend the race.....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!

Now I said I would update this review once I attended the Subway Fresh Fit 500. Well here goes and I am going to tell you EXACTLY what you need to do if your coming to this racetrack. First let me start by saying the oval is a mile in distance and there is not really a bad seat in the house. I sat in the AJ Foyt section Row O Seat 10....great view of pit road and the actual track itself. Now with that being said let me get to my original point.....here again is EXACTLY what you need to do if your planning on coming to a race at P.I.R.

First....and I can't stress this enough.....if your over 40 and NOT in tip top shape buy a parking pass....let me repeat that..... buy a parking pass....because the walk from the general free parking lot is more than a notion folks. So again I don't care how much it is BUY THE PARKING PASS....so you can park as close to the track as possible. There is also an option to park and ride at one of the local hotels for 7 bucks for everyone in the car.....that is an awesome deal. Let me make that clear that is 7 bucks total....NOT PER PERSON....again an awesome deal.

Secondly if you decide to park in the general FREE parking lot areas please take Litchfield road and just follow the signs around to the racetrack. It will take about 10 minutes to get to the track but there will be 3 lanes you can use because they let you use the shoulder as a lane. HOWEVER here is the problem with that....they don't tell you exactly where you need to be and the guards from the Sheriff's office and the local Police Dept. are horrible. Here is what you need to remember if you want to park at the very back of the general parking area in hopes of getting out first then use the lane on the far right (shoulder) because they block of each section of the general parking lot based on what lane your driving in. If you want to park about middle ways then make sure your in the middle lane....and if you want to park in the first section of general parking closest to the track use the lane on the far left which is also another shoulder. I highly recommend if your not in good shape and don't like to walk to far to take the FAR LEFT LANE as you approach the track. However let me advise again BUY THE PARKING PASS or PARK and RIDE.

Next if you do plan on parking for free then get there EARLY....I can't stress this point enough. 9 maybe 10am is the latest you should arrive or you will regret it. If you stay for the entire race you will discover why getting there after 10am will cost you dearly. Let me put it this way....the race on Sunday was over at 4:30pm or so and even though we parked in the rear in hopes of getting out early.....we didn't get home until 7:00pm. That's right I said 7pm....because we were in the lot for over an hour waiting to get out. So again get there EARLY....EARLY....EARLY. Gates open at 8am....so you have no excuse.

Buy your scanner ONLINE and you will save yourself 10 bucks GUARANTEED. Now you will have to go to will-call and get a plastic looking credit card and then you will have take that to one of the MANY scanner vendors and grab your equipment. You will receive the scanner with video if you select FANVISION....a pair of headphones....a charger...and an extra battery which you probably won't really need if use it only when the race starts. If you rent from Racing Electronics you will get everything I just mentioned except for the video portion. These are a little cheaper to purchase and to rent so that is a nice option. 

The nine or so rows of steps that lead over the major parking roadway near the vendors is totally ridiculous. You would think that all the money that over 130,000 plus people bring to P.I.R that they could at least build an escalator and just cover it. If that doesn't work just remove it all together because again for those not in the best of shape this could cause you real problems. So once you come down on the other side everything else is pretty awesome about the place.

Most of the popular Nascar Drivers have a vendor trailer selling everything from T-Shirts to collectibles. You then walk through gate 3 or gate 4 and then just find your seat. Now be advised they are very serious about what you can and CANNOT bring in there....so make sure you call....or check the website before you arrive so you won't be disappointed when you show up at the gate. There are air cushions for sell and for rent as well as some pretty decent seatbacks. The food and drink prices are a bit steep but not unexpected if you attend tons of sporting events like I do. I must say to be totally honest you really shouldn't be spending money on food anyway because they let you bring just about anything edible into the track area. That also goes for anything to drink because they let you bring soft sided coolers inside as well. 

If you remember all of these things....you should have an awesome day at this track....I know I will NEXT TIME. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!

Well let me start with the infamous COKE FREESTYLE MACHINES......they are totally awesome. I mean imagine hundreds of different drink combinations to satisfy your thirst. My personal favorite is the PEACH Sprite and Strawberry Lemonade flavors......simply delicious. This location has been totally renovated and it has a superb modern look to it now. It is very clean....well lit..... and has an electric fireplace which adds a nice ambiance to the place. The staff is friendly and the service is great.....I Always receive my food very fast. If your in the neighborhood.....stop in and give this restaurant a try. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!

Solid food love that pho hung finally closed down.. Their broth here is really good and I love the variety on their menu. My wife loves that they have Bahn xeo which is an crepe/omelette filled with brisket shrimp and bean sprouts  which was delish. Shrimp fried rice was good I love this spot because they have a lot of space. I will be back for the food.

Yes! Yes! Without ever being to NYC, this is THE best bagel I have ever had! Small, family run bagel shop serving breakfast and lunch. They have boars head meats, fresh made bagels daily, great fast service and amazing bagels! I had a sesame bagel with egg (fresh cracked egg) provolone, bacon and tomato with cream cheese on the side. Hits the spot!! If you live in the area this a must go to breakfast and lunch place! Monday through Friday from 5:30am to 11am for $5.25 you can get a breakfast bagel sandwich and coffee/drink! When I lived here I came here often and was anxious to return to have another bagel sandwich!! Great little patio to sit at and have coffee with a small view of the mountain. Can't beat it!!

**Gem Alert**  I am always on the look for spots like this.  The secret restaurant/bar spots that nobody knows about.  My goal: To make people aware of this place so that it stays open and busy.  As you can tell, I love this place. Don't be fooled by the entrance.  You have to trust me and take that leap of faith up the secret corridor of stairs.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and has such a wonderful view of Tryon St. and the Performing Arts Center.  You can relax in a modern Asian/American style ambiance while taking in the busiest part of the city.  Everything is brand new and the bar sports some real sweet flat screens.
 
Now the food... We ordered the lettuce wraps and crab fon doo thingy (fried crab wonton thing). Wow! One more time... Wow!  Real nice size portions and they hit the spot perfectly.  You have multiple spice options: X1, X2, X3, and Death.. Haha.  We did X1 and it was very mild.  Which is just the way my Wife likes it.  They have a great selection of beers on draft and one that is always $2.  Strike up a conversation with the Andys.  Andy and Andy are extremely friendly and they really take care of you.  Great late night atmosphere as well as any lunch/dinner time.  Trust me on this one peoples.  Stop by THE WOK!!  Enjoy!

Update: This restaurant/bar is really starting to blossom and establish itself in the city.  The staff/management are vivacious and knowledgeable.  And honestly, you cannot over-value a good bartender and they have a true professional behind the bar.  Richard, not only, knows his drinks, but he entertains you with his bartending skills and good conversation.  If you get a chance, you gotta meet the manager, Dan.  Extremely friendly and he has this place going in such an exciting direction.  They all truly prioritize the customer's needs above all and that makes everything else even better.  

Trust me on this one peoples.  Stop by THE WOK!!  Enjoy!

Took a chance visiting this restaurant. Chinese food in Charlotte leaves allot to be desired. 

Walking to my car after leaving out of Harris Teeter, I happen to glance over and read the huge sign. Not sure if this was a new place or not, but decided to check it out on Yelp first. Reviews seemed fair.

Walked over and ordered carryout.

Less than 10 minute wait. Drove back home, prayed for my food, and dug in. The shrimp fried rice was great. Not too salty. Shrimps are not microscopic size. Just really good. The orange chicken was meh. Chicken was chewy. The orange glaze was salty and tongue numbing. Not ordering that again.

However, the fried rice is good enough to convince me to return and try another side item. Next time I will try the beef broccoli.

I will keep Yelpers posted.

A little shout out love for my church =) The Rock kind of reminds me of the Cheers theme song...."Where Everybody Knows Your Name."  A church where you can't walk in and out without being noticed and in a good way....trust me I tried escaping unnoticed the first time I visited....it didn't work =) It's a real environment with real people....and most of all we support each other when life gets difficult.  God has shown us what it means to love....and in return it pours out of the people at the Rock....

Pastor Chris Tong shares messages from the Scripture but makes it real by sharing his life experiences.  The Rock is all about reaching and helping the community....Each year, we put on a community BBQ event Memorial Day weekend and each month we feed the homeless at Ethel Pearson Park.  If you're new to the area and interested in finding a community of believers, come check us out!  You won't leave without receiving at least one hug =)

This is a review for Christine, I was referred to her by my makeup artist for wedding day hair for myself and my mother and mother in law.  I ended up scheduling a trial first and the first idea I had turned out to be a disaster and didn't really work with the layers and my thin hair.  We ended up going with a simpler style that looked really good.  Christine was very patient and spent almost 2 hours with me to figure out what I wanted for the day of the wedding.  Come the day of the wedding, she came to my house to do the hair.  She ended up doing slightly tighter curls since my hair tends to fall flat after a few hours.  The hair ended up looking amazing in the photos and I have her to thank!  She also did both mothers, who have very short hair but she was able to give the hair some volume.  She even charged less since their hair was short and didn't require the full work of an up do.  I would definitely recommend her as a bridal party hair stylist!

My wife and I ate lunch there on Sunday March 16th. We got there just after opening and were seated right away. Then our drink orders were taken and quickly brought back to us. We ordered appetizers from the Meat & Cheese bar. We got the Chef's Selection of 6 (I'll submit the pic of the cheese board). This was a great assortment of charcuterie, cheeses, bread and olives. We ordered a Margherita and a Gotham pizza. The pizza was a good thin crust wood oven pizza with a New York meets gourmet twist. Pizza was very flavorful and the crust had a good chew, except for the center of both pies. When we looked closer at the slices we did notice they were stretched a little too thin in the center making the point of the slices a little droopier than normal. The service levels were solid throughout. I would recommend people to eat at Five50 in the future.

A year later and we had a nice pizza lunch at Five50. Service was quick and attentive. Water glasses were promptly filled and everything was great... except,  the same issue with the pizza centers being thinner than the rest of the pizza where it even caused one piece that was being pulled from the pizza pan to leave the 'tip' of the slice behind. Pizza flavors were great and being the creatures of habit that we are, we ordered the margherita and the Gotham pizza. We got the chef's choice charcuterie board and Humboldt Fog goat cheese that spread so smoothly like a soft cream cheese over the crostini to make a perfect little spot for the cured meats. I better stop, I want more. Found out, by the way, the cheese is at Whole Foods. First stop when I get home.

You know what? The price is right. That about sums up this place. This establishment continuously makes nationally recognized lists, and don't get me wrong it is an establishment, but sometimes too much hype leaves one aching for something more...If you've never been here before, relax. It's a diner not a Michelin star and your expectations should reflect that! :)

After a hike around the arboretum my fella and I decided we could splurge. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers (standard order comes with lettuce, tomato, american cheese, and pickles), cheese curds, and a vanilla malt. (Total of $19) Cheese curds were great - standard issue, normal serving, but who is going to argue against fried cheese!! The burgers were classic - served medium. I would sub the cheese for Swiss and ask for the bun to be toasted - but that's just me. The "malt" however was a low point...it lacked malt flavor, had lots of ice chunks, and was very thin...sorry but at $4.50 they can do better! - The server did give us two plastic cups and spoons - so splitting is not extra.-

I like this place. The old charm makes for a fun dining experience. With that being noted I think the location makes it more popular than if it were elsewhere in the city. But, all that said, if I found myself in walking distance I'd probably wander back in.

What you put in is what you get out. This place seems to really encapsulate that notion. If you want to spend $20 for two this may rate low....but if you are willing to actually get some drinks, a meal, and stop thinking about the dollar or two difference, please do. Not hesitate to go here.
      Chips and salsa are delivered instantly - the salsa is a mild with a subtle heat....the chips are warm with a lemon salt (manny's anyone?) plus they have pickled carrots on top!! Love it! Just make sure to move the "pickles" if you don't intend on devouring all of the chips right away.
     My fella and I ordered the traditional lime margaritas on the rocks - the perfect disguise for a decent amount of tequila! Delicious.
    We both ordered skirt steak for the entree...he got the asada and I got the poblano. This was by FAR the best skirt steak I have ever had at a restaurant...the lime marinade came through, perfectly cooked, simply amazing. Seriously, this dish is worth it alone!! The poblano had an incredible amount of scrumptious, melted cheese and the asada had a great splash of guacamole...the tortillas with the entree are also served grilled.

We had a coupon....but this place is worth it...just splurge for the better dishes - it's only a couple bucks and it is oh so worth it!!

*While we did not have dessert the fried ice cream seemed incredibly popular*

This place is amazing! First time I experienced it I was at a good friend of mine house, (who lives above the restaurant), that had them cater a custom meal for a little friendly gathering he had. Food was absolutely unforgettable. Gravy so good you could drink it! Literally!!

Any Who found out that every Tuesdays they do a ramen only night so I had to try it. My first experience there was absolutely amazing. The menu is very simple only letting you choose from 4 different broths and now 2 appetizers. Let's just say that after the first experience I've gone back every single Tuesday for the past month/ 1.5 months! Haven't missed one Tuesday. Every time I've gone I try to introduce friends to experience it and they immediately get hook too. So now I have a group of about 4-5 people that go EVERY tues! I've had every broth and they're all good you can't go wrong. Tonight I even got one to go. 

Been meaning to go in on a regular night but haven't had the pleasure. Looking forward to it and will write a review about it at that time, till then happy eating..........

I tend to seek out the vegetarian restaurants whenever I travel as I want to avoid meat (unless it's organic or free range) and I can't eat gluten. The only issue is I can't eat onion either and many vegetarian restaurants usually pile their dishes full of onion. At Henderson's Bistro this didn't seem to be a problem at all. I ordered the nachos which were gluten free, then just omitted the salsa and instead had a delicious bean salsa. It was delicious! Plenty of cheese, sour cream, guac and nacho chips. The freshly squeezed orange juice was really nice and we had a chocolate nut cake for dessert which was nice though it was quite heavy. The service was good and the bistro was obviously quite popular as it filled up around us. The menu is small but has a good range of options for everyone. I'd certainly eat there again.

We just happened upon the Scottish National Gallery while walking along Princes Street and as it's free thought we'd check it out. It was wonderful! Lots of galleries, lots of really brilliant art and some really lovely Scottish paintings too. The galleries are really well laid out, plenty of room around each painting and I love that they have descriptions for each work of art as many galleries don't seem to do this. There's a little bit of everything in there - Gothic, Renaissance, Impressionism and more! There's also a nice cafe and a shop should you wish to purchase souvenirs. Definitely worth a visit while in Edinburgh!

So heres the deal....If you have an issue with gluten, this place says they can make you a gluten free crust if you give then 24 hours to prepare it.  I guess they do not get enough requests to have this on hand.  I don't know anyone who plans 24 hours in advance to go eat pizza, its more like, I feel like pizza today and you will be out of luck if you cannot pre-plan your visit.

Now they will give you the option to walk over to Whole Foods, purchase your own Gluten Free crust and bring the curst over and they will give you a WHOPPING $2 discount off of $13 pizza.  Well, this SUCKS for you but works for them.  The crust you purchased is $7.99 and the toppings they put on the pizza is NOT WORTH $11.  Portions of the crust had NO toppings or Cheese, so what I paid $11 for, I have no idea.

ALSO, if you order the sausage at this place, they pre cook the sausage part way so when you order it, it can finish cooking in the oven with your pizza.  HOWEVER, if you bring your own Gluten Free crust in, they cannot put the crust all the way in the oven because it will burn the crust.  The problem with this issue, is they do NOTHING to finish cooking the sausage, so you end up with RAW sausage and cold pizza.

If you look at Whole Foods, they now have Gluten Free Pizza's for $4.99 you can take home and cook yourself which tastes way better then the $11 cold pizza served with RAW Uncooked Sausage.  

I guess they don't concern themselves with serving people RAW unsafe meat.  NOW, in THEIR DEFENSE, they did offer to go purchase another crust for me to which I said no thank you, AND they did not charge us for the pizza which did not get eaten, which was a nice gesture for something that was not eaten.  Needless to say, this is a place to NEVER VISIT AGAIN if for nothing else other then, HOW CAN A REAL CHEF/COOK nor anyone else working there NOT notice the center of the pizza looking uncooked (Cheese not melted completely, FIRST CLUE).  This is their specialty and there is no excuse for an expert to not be able to tell the difference between a fully cooked pizza and one that did not get cooked in the center.  This should have been their first clue that maybe, just maybe, the sausage did not get cooked either.

Maybe if the management here were to read these reviews they would see a pattern here in 2013 of people saying the service is EH, the pizza lacked toppings, etc.  

There are way better places to get pizza in this town especially who have GREAT SERVICE, they don't charge $13 plus dollars for crust with skimpy toppings.  They keep this practice going this year, it will be interesting to see where they are or if they are next year.

I like good food, I don't like BS answers and that is what I got today from our server.

The food here is actually really good and worthy of a 4 or 5 star rating normally.  My wife ordered the Settebello Pizza which comes with the house made sausage amongst other items.  I ordered the Diablo and asked to add the house made sausage.

Both pizza's came and in looking at hers, it had big chunks of sausage all over her pizza and looked really good.  I got charged $2.50 to add on the sausage and was VERY disappointed.  3/4 of the pizza had very little sausage on it and the other 1/4 had absolutely NONE. 

I told the waiter and he responded with they use a spoon so its not like they tried to give her more then you.  REALLY???  Just looking at the two you can tell there was a difference and to be charged an extra $2.50 for something they just did not deliver on and to have the server respond like that,  I probably would not be going back here for some time.  I can get a better deal for my money then getting cheated and then treated like and fool by the waiter.

This place does not have my vote and even though the food is good, the value especially when charged extra is NOT.

A hidden gem on the southwest side.  We love juice places and in Las Vegas, a good juice place is hard to find.  Yes, there are a few places which have cold pressed juice in bottles, but a lot of the juices over lap ingredients.  

We have found a few great places in California and many times wished someone would open a place in Vegas that will make some GREAT fresh Organic juice at a decent price.  HERE IS IT FINALLY!!!!

We walk in the door and the ambiance of the place is AWESOME unlike any other place in town.   They have seats at the bar and a few other seats around.  Matt greeted us, he is friendly and very knowledgeable.  They have 17 different juices and 3 milks and my favorite part of this place compared to all the others in town, you have a HUGE selection of juices without ginger.  The point is the juices here are unique in their own way and taste great.

It's like someone from California finally came to Vegas and brought an AMAZING juice place with them.  You can sit at the bar, if your first time here, they give you a very cute little wooden board and a real mini cup, not plastic, and you can sample all 20 if you desire.  There are HUGE signs as well as a small card which lists all the ingredients and prices in clear view, there are no hidden costs here.

This juices are AWESOME, the price of most juices are a little cheaper then the others in town and they have a loyalty program, you give them your phone number and work your way to a free juice.  

This place is worth the drive until they open another one closer to the Green Valley area.  Needless to say we left with 8 bottles and will be back.

A hidden gem on the southwest side.  We love juice places and in Las Vegas, a good juice place is hard to find.  Yes, there are a few places which have cold pressed juice in bottles, but a lot of the juices over lap ingredients.  

We have found a few great places in California and many times wished someone would open a place in Vegas that will make some GREAT fresh Organic juice at a decent price.  HERE IS IT FINALLY!!!!

We walk in the door and the ambiance of the place is AWESOME unlike any other place in town.   They have seats at the bar and a few other seats around.  Matt greeted us, he is friendly and very knowledgeable.  They have 17 different juices and 3 milks and my favorite part of this place compared to all the others in town, you have a HUGE selection of juices without ginger.  The point is the juices here are unique in their own way and taste great.

It's like someone from California finally came to Vegas and brought an AMAZING juice place with them.  You can sit at the bar, if your first time here, they give you a very cute little wooden board and a real mini cup, not plastic, and you can sample all 20 if you desire.  There are HUGE signs as well as a small card which lists all the ingredients and prices in clear view, there are no hidden costs here.

This juices are AWESOME, the price of most juices are a little cheaper then the others in town and they have a loyalty program, you give them your phone number and work your way to a free juice.  

This place is worth the drive until they open another one closer to the Green Valley area.  Needless to say we left with 8 bottles and will be back.  Did I mention the juice choices and tastes are unique and AMAZING???  They even have a Happy Hour..   Rush on over to this place, oh wait no don't, I like that it was easy in and not crowded.

The Cosmopolitan is a beautiful hotel, but I recommend going to the Bond Lounge in the lobby over the pretentious Marquee Club.

There are so many pool parties and clubs to choose from on the Strip.  I recommend going to an establishment that cares about their guests.  Besides, having been to both day and night club at Marquee, my friends and I found the club to be overly packed with an OK crowd at best.  Many people left around midnight including us since we couldn't move at all.  The dance floor was also small for the top 40's music, and downstairs seemed like a rave with rude people.  Ghostbar, Rain, and Moon were so much more fun at the Palms.  Pure at Caesar's is worth checking out for the great view.   But if you still want to check out the newest club on the block, just beware you are in for a night of waiting in multiple lines (even with guest list) and being pushed around and waiting around for pricey drinks with poor management.
*******************************************************************************
Below is my incident at Marquee Day Club:

My letter to the Cosmopolitan Marquee...ignored by the management :(

RE: Pool Platform Hazardous to Guest Safety

Dear Cosmopolitan Marquee Management,

I attended the Cosmopolitan Marquee day club at the pool on Friday, July 15.  Since there were music playing and fellow guests were dancing on the plastic box containers in the pool.  I decided to join in so I climbed on the clear raised platform by putting both of my knees up on the box; then I stood up on the box, which had a grid of raised squares with very sharp corners.  As I got on the platform, I felt a sudden pain on my left knee, then the crowd started to yell "You're bleeding!"  I looked down to see blood gushing down from my knee so I hurried to get out of the pool.  

I informed the gentleman patrolling inside the pool of the sharp top of these box containers that are meant to be climbed upon.  He sent me to security by the door.  Then, a security personnel with black tattoos on both of arms came over, and I told him that the clear platform was very sharp and cut my knee.  He told me to follow him across the courtyard to get first aid.  I already wiped off the blood on my knee when I got out of the pool, but blood continued to run down my leg so I had to wipe it off again, and he made a mean remark, "I would prefer it if you didn't use our towels, but oh well, too late now!"  Not only was the security staff inconsiderate, he was downright rude and sarcastic.  

At the first aid station, I told the Cosmopolitan/Marquee employees that they should remove those boxes in the pool for guest safety.  The same security staff sneered and said "Yea, I can't do anything.  People get stupid cuts like this all the time."  I was shocked that no one cared about the danger the clear boxes pose to the safety of their guests.  

So before exiting Marquee, I tried to warn the staff about the dangerous hazard again.  I spoke with the service manager named Danny/Denny, and he just kept saying "We just got those boxes, and no one has ever cut themselves."  He didn't seem to get the fact that my incident can be the first of many.  I had expected a little more consideration from the manager, but he treated me like I was just a drunk drama queen who got a small scrape.  I have attached a picture of the cut taken after the cut was band-aid; you can see that my skin was lifted off the knee by the sharp grinds on top of the clear box in the pool.  The finger in the photograph serves as reference of the size of the scrape; my skin is still raw and my knee is sore from the incident.

I am quite disappointed and shocked by the disregard and insolence of your staff.  There was no compassion or courtesy from the staff who handled this incident.  The management must be aware that the top of the boxes have a sharp top, which can easily hurt your guests.  The unsafe boxes placed inside the pool need to be removed or reconstructed to insure guest safety; it is a lawsuit waiting to happen as your staff just shrugs off the incident and disregards guests' concerns.  I hope your prestigious hotel and popular club, especially being the newest additions to the Strip, would offer your guest a safe environment on your premise and train your staff to treat guests with courtesy and respect.  Thank you for your consideration.

Their pizza is awesome. I lived around the corner from them for a couple years. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 is bc sometimes some of the guys that work there can be terse and rude. Some of them are really nice, some are not.

I really wish I could review their food, but I can't because they F***ING RAN OUT IN HALF AN HOUR. Although they only had enough food to give the customers that arrived in the first half hour their orders, they continued taking orders for another 30 or 40 minutes. Then they announced that they were no longer taking orders and had run out of food. So we thought "wow that was close!"  NOPE... 20 minutes later they told us they didn't have enough food for us either even though we had already ordered (along with 15 other people). On top of all that The attendant apologize a little bit for what it happened, but eventually got an attitude as customers got frustrated and eventually said "I don't need this!" Neither do we, sir; we need tacos. Very disappointed since I heard the food was good, but the business is very poorly managed. If I could somehow give them a negative one star review I would for the hour of my life they took.


PS: I write this from the drive-through at Wendy's, because they don't run out of food.

St-Viateur bagels are without a doubt some of the best bagels on the planet. This restaurant, however, is a complete joke.

For starters, we waited 15 minutes before getting up and going to ask for a menu ourselves. We then tried to get one of the three waitresses' attention so we could finally order, but still no luck there. All 4 waitresses on duty while we were there completely ignored us. After almost 20min waiting, I got up to ask a waitress for the menu. Then I had to get up once again to order a coffee, AND to order. So just to recap, not one single waitress came to our table. Oh and I also had to ask for water. Once we finally got our meal, both orders were wrong but we were so hungry that we said we'd just eat and pay. Once we waited so long to ask someone for the bill that I almost got up and walked out of the restaurant. It probably would have gone unnoticed but I just couldn't bring myself to do something like that. Crappy service and a total tourist trap, unfortunately.

REVIEW FROM 2013/ AMELIOS: POSITIVE  Best pizza in Montreal, hands down!. Title says it all. Try the 5 cheese pizza, you won't regret it - one of the best things I've ever eaten! The pasta is very good too. Waiting for a table seems to be the biggest "problem" at Amelios so go early since they don't take reservations, won't seat a group until everyone has arrived and since they close early! Cash only.

I can get skeptical when it comes to going out for lunch or supper at a chain type restaurant but my colleagues reserved a table here for lunch a few days ago so I thought what the heck. 

Turns out the food was actually a lot better than what I was expecting, or maybe I was just really HUNGRY by the time my food made it's way to me! 

The horrible service is the reason this experience was a bad one. We were a table of 8 and two of us ordered before everyone else and specified to the waitress that we were going to dine and head out before the rest of the group because we had an important meeting. We still had an hour ahead of us so we were not too stressed. The rest of our table ordered about 15 minutes after us, yet all 6 of them were served almost right away. The waitress was rude and kept telling us it "wasn't her fault" instead of just apologizing for the wait.

We waited for 40 minutes longer and by that time everyone had finished their plates and had to sit there waiting for us. At this point, the waitress just tried to avoid us so as not to have to come check up on us and reassure us. Still not quite sure how it took over an hour to make 2 pizzas after they made an error with our order.

The least we would have expected was for a manager or someone to come apologize and offer us our meals, but since that never happened we just grabbed our food when it was finally ready and left the restaurant.

Being born and raised in Las Vegas, I grew up going to Las Vegas Stars baseball games here back when they were owned by the Padres and were still called the Stars in the good ol' days lol. Saw my first ever baseball games as a kid here in this stadium, it seemed a lot bigger back then. To this day I still enjoy swinging by with my wife or buddies to catch a ballgame and just relax in the warm summer nights with a cold Dr Pepper and hot dog mmmm. Games are as good a deal as ever with two for one tickets for Club Ride card holders, and with Dollar Menu Night on top of that you can't go wrong! (Dollar menu night is for hot dogs, popcorn, peanuts, cracker jacks, and pretzels.) Tickes are nice and simple $20, $14, $13, $10 I believe is what it is. Easy access off the I-515/US-95 with Las Vegas Blvd or I-15 via Washington, or ride RTC Transit route 113 or 208 to get dropped off right in the cultural corridor and skip the traffic and parking fees. Sure the nae may be a little cheesey, but if you live in Vegas for any amount of time you've got to swing by and enjoy a night out at the ballpark in the summertime for a great deal. Can't beat a $10 baseball game Triple-A or not!

Las Vegas Wrangler Hockey baby! Been coming to the games myself since 2007, I saw an ad on TV for the annual midnight hockey game and the rest is history! It's always a great value, fun to hang out and cheer on the local ice hockey team, and Duke is pretty awesome himself too! For the most part the team has been pretty good and wins quite often which helps for sure lol. Bring your friends, bring your family, bring everyone, the more the merrier defenitly applies here. The games are usually more full on the weekends, the Tuesday games are more lax. Word of advice: come when they play Alaska Aces, those games are always wayyyy more awesome because the two teams hate each other. More often you come, the more you will want to come to the next game! Learn the chants and get into it! My only complaint is the crowds are a little small sometimes, but that's not theteams fault, it's the flaky people in this city. So come on out! We have all four big sports between the UNLV Runnin' Rebels (basketball), two-time champs Las Vegas Locos (football), the Las Vegas 51's (Triple A baseball) and our very own Las Vegas Wrangler hockey team (the Phoenix Coyotes are the parent NHL club to us). So come on out and support the Las Vegas community and be a part of our great city. You're gonna have a good time!

Place was empty, ugly. But very pleasantly surprising. My order was taken by a very nice lady that spoke English and Spanish! I read all the great reviews on the tacos so I had to try some. Got 3 asada tacos and 3 pork tacos. Came out very hot! Aye the pork first, lots of good flavor in there. They give you all kinds of fixins for your tacos! Pork was very good. Then the asada tacos. They were ok, kind of bland so you need to flavor it up with everything. Still everything was very good, you can tell they have good quality meat and products. I will come back.

The place is nice, a little in organized but they were busy for a Sunday morning. As should be expected. Arrived at 11:10, seated at 11:15, ordered food and got our drinks by 11:20. So far, so good. Place has music, mostly oldies. It can be a little noisy when it's busy. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I Always see everyone cleaning. Of course my wife had to point at the cob webs in the corners, haha. The wife ordered the colonel, I ordered the copper queen skillet. Got our food at 11:42... 22 minute wait until we ordered. Not bad. We finished our food at 12:00. Got our check at 12:04. Cashed out and left at 12:06. I will be coming back! I like this place.

The place is nice, a little un organized but they were busy for a Sunday morning. As should be expected. Arrived at 11:10, seated at 11:15, ordered food and got our drinks by 11:20. So far, so good. Place has music, mostly oldies! It can be a little noisy when it's busy. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I Always see everyone cleaning. Of course my wife had to point at the cob webs in the corners, haha. The wife ordered the colonel, I ordered the copper queen skillet. Got our food at 11:42... 22 minute wait until we ordered. Not bad. We finished our food at 12:00. Got our check at 12:04. Cashed out and left at 12:06. I will be coming back! I like this place.

I'd like to excuse myself in advance for any vulgarity expressed in this review for my experience with the STM hasn't been the most pleasant.

Okay so first of all I'd like to say that this review is not addressed towards DOWNTOWN STM but WEST-ISLAND's STM WHICH IS THE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORSE PIECE OF SHIT SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD!

FIRST OF ALL, I'd like to talk about the 217 and the 425. During winter, for some reason, there is 1 chance out of 4 that they simply DO NOT pass. No, not that they are late by 5 minutes... they simply DO NOT COME. Once I waited for 2 425s in a row and a 217. NOBODY came and I just decided to go back home and skip class. I came late to work 3 times in 3 months because the 419 was not there and I ran to the 217 bus to get to work late. It's AWFUL.

Second of all, the drivers man... ha ha... Fuck. The 419 driver in the morning of Wednesday (12-11-13) who was not only late 10 minutes but also took the wrong turn following the 219 route and ended up doing a 15 minute detour to get to Fairview got me late for work. When I confronted him, he replied with "Hey, it happens, what do you want me to do?". Oh, I don't know. Maybeeeeeeee NOT READ THE JOURNAL WHILE YOU DRIVE. FUCKING RETARD. 

Believe I'm pulling this out of my ass, here, have a picture.
https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1.0-9/1525254_10153618305210103_773641187_n.jpg

I complained to the STM by email. I simply got a big fat "lol ok" from them. This is what happens when you have the monopole of something.

I had bus drivers on numerous occasions that stopped in the middle of the fucking street to get something to eat at a dep! Thank you 217 bus driver for showing me that the STM sucks twice in a month. You're already late 9 minutes and you choose to stop randomly on a 1 lane road close enough to an intersection to incapacitate the circulation to buy yourself a can of Red Bull, a bag of Sunchips and a sandwich making me lose another 10 minutes then sit down at your seat for another 2 minutes to eat your fucking sandwich.

https://scontent-b-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/v/t34.0-12/1533505_10153648952985103_504751183_n.jpg?oh=9b8d9359fce3c4e43206e8ad17c48ab3&oe=53464855

WTF! 

Here is a picture of the 217 driver that decided to STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF A 4-WAY INTERSECTION TO HAVE A CHAT WITH THE OTHER 217 DRIVER ABOUT BAD DRIVERS. HOLY SHIT PEOPLE. Are they like elementary school drop outs or something? They moved after getting honked for 2 minutes. A guy even got out of his SUV walking rapidly towards the bus.

https://scontent-b-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/v/t34.0-12/1081472_10153063301715103_644744380_n.jpg?oh=52d62ccfb7e5d0721c258f700188fed4&oe=5345F087

Downtown it's almost perfect. Buses are never late or missing, metro is smooth, never had a problem with anything. In the suburbs, it is TERRIBLE.

Going to George and Sons is like going home and having my mom cook me a homemade meal - having grown up in the area George and Sons was a frequent take out spot as a teenager! The food was good then and it's just as good if not better now! They have killer egg rolls, they don't skimp on portions (imagine a shrimp dish with more than half a dozen shrimp!) and service was awesome and imagine my surprise when good ol' George was there not only greeting patrons but bussing tables and ensuring things ran smoothly! They have live music on Saturday nights, and awesome lunch buffet during the week and a full bar!

This specialized Baby Store is everything a mother or a mother-to-be can wish for. Lots of strollers, furniture and cribs selections are to be had in a spacious environment where staff on repeated visits have more than helpful to my mother-to-be wife and I.

Plenty of clothes are available for babies of all ages and many items are available for whatever need you may have.

However, kindly note that for some electronic devices you're better off comparing prices for them online or at other stores as I found far more reasonable deals for them elsewhere. 

For example, if a baby monitor is sold here at $300, you can easily find the same one, brand new, a few blocks away for $200. They should not mark up their prices to this degree.

Probably the best Adonis in the Montreal area. Biggest with the grandest of selections. 

You go to Adonis to have high quality fruits and veggies, meat cuts as well as selection of good that you will NEVER find at Maxi at the prices that nearly match it that makes a complete mockery of IGA.

This is not your mom and pop store, it's HUGE with several butchers working behind the counter, a pastry place as well as a fast food place where you can pick up some hot grub. I've never done this in this location but have in other locations and most items are a hit or miss variety.

Word of caution, if you dislike huge crowds avoid this place on weekends. You've been warned. It's pretty insane and people are generally purposely being inconvenient to others (leaving the carts in the middle or lanes, being there in groups).

The service is a hit or miss variety, you better hope the butchers or the meat cutters on duty are fresh and willing to work or expect to wait 5-15 minutes to get your cut.

But all in all a great place to shop at.

There are many Belle Provinces in the Montreal / Laval region. In fact, I have 3 of them within a 2 km radius from my house. Yet, this one in particular plays the part of a fairy tale.

The key words are : "just right" 

The poutine sauce is "just right". The meat sauce is "just right". The hamburgers, the hot dogs, the fries are "just right".

This is special since many Bell Provinces and the variety of the namesake consistently fail in providing delicious food, on a CONSISTENT basis.

The service is lightning fast and amicable and the prices are extremely affordable.

Scores is growing rotisserie chain that I've been visiting over the course of the last few years. The menu has changed over the years with a lot of new options provided. My favorite is the chicken and bacon focaccia and in the past it was served on a very fresh, huge ciabatta bread and now it has changed to a more.... economical style bread in both quality and size but still retains its grandness but what can one expect in Laval, land of the chain restaurants? 

Their chicken is solid, so is their chicken tenders. I think I ordered their chicken burger once as well and it was solid. All in all, good grub, for a chain.

However, their side orders beyond the average fries and excellent onion rings are pretty terrible. The rice lacks flavor, the vegetables (if you call them that) are stale, taste like processed food and probably are less healthy than the fries.

They have a salad bar for a few bucks more but I never bothered. Why eat salad at a Rotisserie? :P

The Pouding chomeur 'a la mode' is out of this world and a personal favorite as well.

Service is generally solid and you get taken care of. Refills are never a problem. The price tag is reasonable with a lot of options available during their lunches that don't hit your wallet too much.

All in all, a nice place to eat at, if you select things you know are good.

L'Oeufrier is a breakfast chain established back in 1995 that is currently quickly expanding in and around Montreal region that I feel that within the next few years will be at the tip of everyone's tongue as the place to go to get a great breakfast much to the likes of Allo Mon Coco is today in Laval.

When I walked in with my wife and infant I expected something good but our experience here surpassed it by far and it was nothing short of excellence across the board and I can't wait to go into the details as to why I enjoyed my experience here so much.

L'Oeufrier offers a huge variety of breakfast, brunch, lunch grub within a neat and polish little book that will simply make you more hungry than you already were when you walked in. You usually tend to get anywhere between 2 to 6 menu pages in most breakfast places... they have nearly 20. Insane! The selection is overwhelming and in a way, blissful as you can come back over and over and try new things.

They have the standard type of breakfasts you can usually get elsewhere, shakes, smoothies, various egg Benedict dishes, omelets, poutine breakfasts?!?, patati patata?!?, grilled cheeses, crepes, waffles, brioches, french toasts... etc. The lunch menu has sandwiches, salads and burgers... all in all, the choices are numerous.

We went with Le Petit Gourmand (eggs, bacon, sausage, banana/chocolate crepe) and Ole Coco (same thing with only standard crepes with a lot fruits) variety breakfasts. They were extremely good across the board. The eggs were done to perfection, the sausages were good and bacon was.... as good as bacon usually is. The fruits were of top quality and very fresh and the crepes were just right. 

The coffee hit the spot and consequent refills were done quickly and efficiently. The extremely friendly and super accommodating waitress we had went above and beyond. The food came quickly and I was offered things you don't get elsewhere as much as you should.... normal maple syrup or the "real kind". I opted for the real kind and it was awesome.

I noticed she was very familiar with her regular patrons, I thought it complimented the place a lot. I hope to get the same sort of treatment down the line as well.

In particular note, the bread is quite special and comes from Premiere Moison. It is of the superior variety with long thin slices of bread, toasted to perfection that truly complimented the meal we had. What an excellent idea.

The price tag is reasonable for what is offered.

Will I come back? Absolutely!!!! Most likely this upcoming weekend and will probably be incorporated in our regular resto rotations if this excellence keeps up. Odds are, we'll be trying out the specialty plates like the poutine breakfast, the patati patata, egg Benedict and so forth.

L'Oeufrier... je t'aime.

I haven't been to Karoun in my many years but after taking a random takeout here I plan to remedy this as this place is the best middle eastern takeout food I can get near work.

I went with their shishtaouk/shawarma platter and it was filled with meat. The meat was very good. The portion of rice and salad was very big as well. I compared my experience similar to what I get to Amir but the quality of the food a huge step than what I'd get there.

The price-tag was very reasonable.

I should come back more often.

Petinos means rooster in Greek and that's a good thing since you'll certainly need one if you plan to wake up during the weekends to get to Petinos early enough to avoid the much warranted line-ups outside this breakfast joint. This place is busy... real busy.... and for good reason!

Their website vaguely boasts a variety of 250 choices to choose from and when you'll get around to the menu.... you can see why! They have something for everyone and you can mix it up to get what YOU want.

I went with the "Le Petinos" a huge breakfast plate with a variety of meats and eggs. I won't necessarily break it down how everything tasted but overall it was simply exceptional with no disappointments. I particularly loved their home-style potatoes that were simply out of this world good. The other patrons at my table all enjoyed their meals with very well presented grub even though they had a lot of clients at the door. They truly ensure to make sure you don't feel rushed when you're dining there. Did I mention to potatoes? Yeahhhhhh.... but everything else was on spot too... but them taters..... *drool*

The service was really good as well despite how busy it was. It was attentive with plenty of coffee refills. She brought crayons for my daughter. She played with her. Very sweet. The food arrived in a timely fashion (child first! awesome ) along with every needed check-up as we ate away. It was impressive.

Will be back.

What more needs to be said? Best poutine in town bar none. Service fast and friendly.  Soda served in cans and bottles instead that watered down crap too many joints try to serve you with.

This place is unique in the way you can either order preset templates of poutine off the menu or you can customize a poutine EXACTLY THE WAY YOU WANT IT.

Seriously, why isn't this done at more places?

If you never have had poutine here before... fix that.

Self serve frozen yogurt? What a FANTASTIC IDEA!

Want a treat and want do it completely by yourself? This is the place to go. You can choose your flavor of yogurt (or choose several of them if you want), take the amount you want (you pay by weight - not selection) then proceed to choose the toppings you wish to garnish it with (there were about 40-50 of them), pay for it then ravage that delicious treat!

Be careful though, it can get a little EXPENSIVE but what an innovative fun way to making your frozen yogurt treat the way YOU WANT IT.

I went with half chocolate / half coconut yogurt with brownies and coconut shavings. The chocolate side was amazing, the coconut was too sweet for my taste. All in all very good. Will try again.

They also serve crepes, it was... duly noted for my next visit. :)

A few months ago, I bought a coupon for a "festin" (aka, EAT YOUR HEART OUT) off a website and decided to finally cash it in..

ART:brgr is located beside Laurier Metro station, this joint is located just off St.Denis and can be somewhat easy to miss with its tiny sign. The "festin" consisted of a classic burger, poutine a drink (alcoholic or not) as well as desert. I had to reserve a full 24 hours in advance and did so in the afternoon as I was visiting with my whole family as well as my 5 month old daughter. The resto has a nice ambiance and style that was warm and inviting.

Firstly, the service was really good, probably because of our time arrangement (2 PM). Our hostess was very polite and friendly to our little baby girl and special arrangements was taken care of. The food came quickly enough and she constantly checked on us to make sure if everything was well. Kudos to this.

I ordered a simple classic burger with some bacon and extra cheese because after all, why live to 80, right? The burger was good but not excellent as I wasn't asked HOW I wanted my burger and got well done (even crispy) and I like mine medium rare. Perhaps I should have went with one of the many other special burger options. Nonetheless, I was satisfied.

The poutine was delicious and probably the best experience I've eaten here during this visit.

The side coleslaw was might tasty as well but far too spicy for my taste sadly.

The desert consisted of a fried mars bar as well as some ice cream. I barely had room for this, I needed to be barreled out of the side door.

All in all, a nice place to eat. Not sure if I'd come back though.

There are several locations today of this trending breakfast chain, much prefer the Fabreville location rather than the St-Dorothe one.


Pros :

- Many delicious breakfast options to choose from. My favorite plate by far is the Choco Coco but feel free to try out their many many delicious options.

- Plates are HUUUUUGE.

- The potatoes are fantastic, especially with the 50/50 cheese on it. A great way to start a day with this brunch.


Cons :

- Always packed during the weekends from 9 AM to 12 PM and this location is far better than the St-Dorothe location where wait times can go upwards to an hour wait.

- Terrible seating arrangements at times. Nothing is more frustrating than waiting for half an hour while you look at a couple having breakfast in a huge 4 seat bunkers and having to wait even longer when you're in a bigger group.

- Service is very hectic and the quality of it differs wildly from one server to the next. Sometimes you get a fantastic waiter who sees you right away, brings your coffee promptly, refills regularly, bothers to chat with you and provide you some level of entertainment, makes sure you're happy, then more times than not, you get.... nothing. Wait 30-40 minutes to get in, get seats, only get your coffee 10-15 minutes after seating... trying to get their attention to order? Unacceptable.

Overall, I recommend Allo Mon Coco, it's a great place to eat. However, service leaves to be desired. Perhaps they require more staff to deal with the popularity they earned, or better business practices on how to get things done better... or simply better training on how to get your clients taken care of in a professional and amicable way will not only solve the lack of service and long waits.... will not only solve their long waits.... but also earn everyone involved more money at the end of the day.

This was my first visit to this increasingly popular joint while I was visiting St-Rose.

There were line-ups, which is ALWAYS a thing for a breakfast place in Laval during the weekend at 12 PM. This was a welcomed change from my favorite resto place such as Allo Mon Coco. Its greatest failings were always the wait to get in and terrible seating arrangements (using a 4 bunker to sit 2 guests while 20 guests are waiting).

But how did Coco Loco stand to its competition?

Surprising well!

Service was relatively quick, our waitress was very friendly and efficient. Coffee and water  was topped off twice without request and our meals were provided in a timely fashion.

Thus... I'm a fan!

The decor is modern and there's plenty of space between you and other guests. 

Sadly, we were placed near the side door that the staff kept using for their guests on the exterior patio. Needless to state their repeated in and outs bothered us with sudden gusts of humidity and warmth while we were sitting comfortably in a well conditioned restoraunt.

I ordered the Dulcura, crepes filled with dulce de leche and served with strawberries and bananas. They were very tasty, albeit quite sweet. The portion was very big and I left satisfied with my choice.

The price tag was reasonable.

The menu is huge and lots of choices can be had to have an awesome breakfast. I recommend visiting this place at least once, its well worth it.

I've stopped here for coffee a few times, and each time I go through the drive-through. Each time, my order gets messed up in some way. The coffee itself, however, typically makes up for everything else. 

The drive-through speaker is definitely messed up. It's hard to hear the employees, and I'm guessing it's hard for them to hear orders. That, or DonutTron 2000 keeps screwing up my order. Stupid robots.

This is a great new location. The building and grounds are really expansive, and it has the feel of a German beer hall and Biergarten. It must have just opened when I first went, because the food options other reviewers described were not yet available; there was just a ghetto-looking food truck (no service window) parked in the Biergarten. I'm glad they seem to have resolved that issue.

My major gripe about this place is about OMB itself. Why are there so few varieties of beer? Why doesn't a brewery experiment with new brews?! The beer selection is generally good, but it's incredibly boring.

Score! When I went over Christmas they were having a huge sale. I ended up getting a flannel shirt and two t-shirts for under $100. The prices are high but no more than at any other UO. For some reason I really suck at packing outfits when I go on vacation. I always forget something or end up packing 15 shirt and 2 pair of pants. All of which don't match! I can always find something here for any occasion whether it's something comfortable for a day hiking trip or something a bit more trendy for going out at night.

This wasn't quit what I had expected. I wouldn't classify it as a Outlet mall, well at least not the kind I'm use to in California. It was a nice outdoor Mall but they sure weren't outlet prices. It's a nice mix of high end (coach, juicy,burberry) and lower end (Rue21,Charlotte Russe)store, but again, I didn't notice any price differences from the regular stores. We went the day after Christmas and even then the deals weren't fantastic. The place was jam packed with people and it was crazy trying to maneuver around the crowds. I also hated being asked about 500 times "where are you from?" from the employees. so irritating!!!

I only hope that one day, Bradbury's will be able to expand into a larger space. I want to curl up here on my computer, but it's a little cramped.

For now, I will embrace it as it is: a lovely spot to discover your love for crepes - savory or sweet, they are complex, delightful creations that pair well with a great pourover. And they are seriously nailing these pourovers. Today, it's an Ethiopia Guji Uraga roasted by Ruby in Monroe, Wi. Easily the best cup of coffee I've had in a month.

I'm still hungry after eating a smoked trout crepe, and I have to be somewhere in 20 minutes. Good thing they whip them up so quickly and that I wanted to try the dark chocolate and caramel crepe for dessert!

For now, I will embrace it as it is: a lovely spot to discover your love for crepes - savory or sweet, they are complex, delightful creations that pair well with a great pourover. And they are seriously nailing these pourovers. Today, it's an Ethiopia Guji Uraga from Ruby Roasters in Wi. Easily the best cup of coffee I've had in a month.

I'm still hungry after eating a smoked trout crepe, and I have to be somewhere in 20 minutes. Good thing they whip them up so quickly and that I wanted to try the dark chocolate and caramel crepe for dessert!

Love the chicken chipotle pizza along with the stuffed pizzas.  There are at least three or four appetizers that are top notch as well.  This place is always crazy crowded, but the food is excellent.

The menu here is varied and interesting.  The appetizer selection in particular is quite good.  The drink selection is also more than adequate.  I found the service to be very good, and the ambiance of the outdoor patio is excellent.  The only item that I tried that I thought was average was the Ahi Tuna entree.  It was not bad, but was not as impressive as the rest of the meal.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the experience and would recommend as a good place for a special occasion dinner.

You! The hungry one!
Be careful! Take small portions!
Try everything!

Go at 3:30
And you can eat lunch, and stay
for some great dinner

The interior
is not as impressive as
some reviewers say

One bit of this and
one bite of that. I am full.
Then go back for more!

Love this airport. The stat everyone in Vegas cites is 40 million passengers per year. 

With that kind of volume comes extreme efficiency and professionalism that this frequent traveler for one really appreciates. 

MacCarran has simply put 'good bones.' It offers the quickest path from city center to gate of any major airport and metro area globally I've visited. Only in Vegas can you pass the time at the gate at a slot machine.

My favorite of all the rental options I've tried in Las Vegas. Friendly folks, efficient service and depending on how you book one of the best values for your money. Plus impeccably friendly and efficient service. 

Please note Thrifty and Dollar share the same location, queue and staff in this airport location. Go with which ever brand gives you the best price, I always seem to find the best package deal for dollar on kayak, which probably partially explains how busy this location is. 

The cars are not assigned at the desk but rather you pick from several options in the garage which saves both the customer and the company time. Smart. Often I book a midsize car which is then upgraded to a full size on the spot for free when the midsize aisle is empty.

Maybe it's the Lamborghini dealership next door rubbing off. Hats off to Audi Henderson for delivering one of the least enjoyable car-buying experiences I've had. The salesman I worked with was fine, attentive and grounded but ultimately an un-empowered exception. Brittle is maybe the best word I can conjure up to describe the aura of enough of the rest of the team, sufficient to sour the whole dealership. 

This dealer's model favors existing customers trading in. Overpay on the trade and the new and resale prices stay artificially high. Throw in some discounted maintenance to ameliorate the sticker shock to new customers. Their logic here is basically: as a new customer you should pay more than book because a) 'you get to deal with us' and b) because we paid too much on the trade. Meh. Their used car manager probably keeps voodoo dolls of the salesmen in his desk. 

If you're an existing customer and don't mind the vibe, awesome. If not, there are many other dealerships in the area that will treat you with professionalism, fairness and humility. Henderson Mercedes, Findlay Toyota, Range Rover, and Audi of Las Vegas to name a few. Never mind all the regional opportunities readily available on the Internet. 

As for me, I just bought my Audi today from across town. More on that experience in another post. I'm ecstatic!

Experience: ordered some pasta and some soda online for delivery. It was a Wed night @ 8:30 pm. 

Service:  so the order did not take long to arrive, but when I opened the pastas, both of them were made incorrect. This blows my mind, since it was made online, so not much room for interpretation. 
When I called a lady answered, and I told her both of my pastas were made incorrectly, she asked me what I ordered, and I told her that I placed the order online, so it was in black and white, but yet they were still wrong. As I started to tell her the mistakes, she cut me off and told me she had a new person starting, and there was no call for that, and she would have them remade and sent out immediately, thank you very much...but before I could even respond to find out what had her so upset, she hung up!!!!!  
Now, I was both irritated AND offended. I couldn't believe she hung up on me. I assume this person who is new and making all the mistakes has her on edge, but I'm the customer and this shouldn't be my problem. 
Anyway, so I tried to call back to get her name, so I could call her boss the next day, but she answered the phone by saying curtly without a breath..."Ma'am, your order is on the way, and sorry for mistake, and thank you" and then hung up again!  Wow!!! 
So, then I decided there is no way in hell, I'm eating whatever this chic is spitting in, so I called back again to try and ask for a refund, but again, she answered saying that "ma'am your order is on the way to stop calling", so I tried to talk over her and said "but I want a refund, not the order", and she said, "He's on the way" and hung up. 
So, I called back again, and tried to ask for her name, and make sure she was sending a refund and not more pasta.  She did not let me get in a word again, but I did hear her say the driver was returning with my money and then she hung up on me again. 
Finally the last time I called, she answered somewhat politely, and said "yes ma'am?" And I told her all I wanted was her name. "She informed me I didn't need her name, and it was ridiculous how many times I called, and it was harassment, and I was being rude" and surprise, surprise...she hung up on me again!  The funniest part was when she said I was being rude.  I'm assuming she is a manager, and it just blows my mind that she thought the way she was treating me was appropriate....even if she thinks I was being inappropriate by saying the order was in black and white. I only said this so she wouldn't think it was my miscommunication on a phone order. Also, I wouldn't have to call five times, if you would have just let me speak, even the first time. 
I sure hope they record those phone calls!!!!!  
They will be able to see how irrational she was behaving. 
I will be contacting management tomorrow, of course. 
BTW, the driver Daniel, was very professional when he returned and gave me my money back. Too bad he wasn't the manager working!  Whoever this nameless manager is, she needs to learn a little professionalism from her employees. 

Good: couldn't tell you...returned it! 

Overall:  I sure hope whomever I talk to in the chain will have a little more professionalism than this lady did. We order from this spot about once or twice a month, and the manager tomorrow will completely determine if I switch to Pizza Hut or Papa Johns, or return again only when I am sure she is not on duty though. Wouldn't ever be able to trust her with my food, when she goes off that hard over nothing. I know I was irritated, but it's not like I was abusive and called her names or cursed at her. I probably should have, then her irrational behavior might have been justified. But either way, dealing with unhappy customers is part of their job. I bet they even have training on it. She must have missed that class. 
Anyway, hope you have better luck than we did, and you don't have to deal with such outrageous behavior from someone in their customer service. 

Note...I was reading another review of this place and saw someone else had issues with this store "hanging up on them". Is this standard practice for this store?  If so, is this what dominoes is teaching how to deal with customers?? I sure hope not, but that will make my decision of return business pretty simple.

Experience:  tried this place with a few friends for lunch. 

Facility:  I was truly surprised by the inside of this restaurant. It had a hotel casual dinning room feel. I'm so used to the typical small Mom and Pop diner feel in most Thai places around town. It was very clean, with comfortable booths and tables. 

Service:  there was nothing too impressive nor was there anything disappointing about the service. It was just good service. 

Food:  this is now officially my second fav Thai place. I enjoyed everything I had. We ordered from the lunch menu, which came with a soup started. It was like an egg drop soup meets chicken soup. It was decent, but after tasting one bite, I didn't want to waste my stomach space on it, so I gave it to a friend. 
Spicy Basil Pork dish - 5/5 It was so good. It had a nice spice at level 4 outta 5 and a good mix of slight tart and basil. 
Pad See Ew - very good!  Had a good flavor with big chunks of pork, noodles cooked perfect, and slightly bitter greens to balance the dish. 
Pad Thai - I tasted this on someone else's plate and it was good, but too sweet for me. 

Overall:  I enjoyed my food so much, that I would definitely come back. Folks at my table said there are other locations, but the food is the best at this one. I believe them.

I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).  

If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good. 

Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. 

Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!

I wish I could leave a better review as both someone in the industry and a friend of one of the waitresses but I just can't. 6pm on a Wednesday and the service was awful. Sipping your water while we sit at our table unserved for 15 minutes since we walked in? Overpriced hot dogs (almost tasty but over flavored), no follow up on accessories like ketchup, 20+ minute wait for a hot dog? When it's not busy? No. Ordered a black velvet, got a Guinness that had some cider poured on top (THAT IS NOT A FU**ING BLACK VELVET). Serve spilled fries all over a friend as she walked by even though she had PLENTY of room. Managed chilled out texting the whole time. Really disappointed that this place was great the first time then so awful the subsequent times. I shouldn't have to walk up to the bar to ask for my friends water 30 minutes after we asked. If there are 3 people at a table and you've only brought one drink then you should have a *click* go off to tell you that MAYBE you forgot something. Cheese isn't even melted on the poutine. You guys should be able to do FAR better than this. Womp Womp.

This place is phemominal! First of all, it is a coffee shop that serves food over lunch hours. The coffee is decent but it's really the food and the service that make this place shine.

All the sandwhiches on the menu are delicious and made with Boar Head's meat. The real gem are the Russian Dumplings called Pelmeni. These are meat and potato dumplings with melted butter, cilantro, curry powder, and spicy sauce, eaten with sour cream on the side. If you never had them, you are missing out! I probably go here at least once a week for the dumplings. Call ahead to see if they have them because they are so popular, sometimes they run out mid-week. All the ingredients are also local.

The owners are great and I love supporting this local buisness! They also have free wifi and a children's play area. This place is worth the stop in.

The dumplings were uninspired and probably made from a frozen premade batch. The miso ramen was very good but the pork ramen was a bit too salty. Overall it was a pleasant experience and worth a trip.

A hip coffee shop with super cool staff! About a 10 minute walk from Beaubien metro. 

The shop can seat about 12 people, so it is not your huge Second Cup ... but your experience at Cafe Odessa is more personal and the music makes the ambiance unique. 

Good coffee, I sampled three types, having the Ethiopian be my #1, the Costa Rica my #2, and the Rwanda my #3. 

Be sure to visit the cafe on Saturday where you can also purchase & try the ammmmazing doughnuts!!!

I'm looking forward to my next visit.

I had a sampling at Kyo Bar Japonais tonight and everything was fantastic!!!

YOU HAVE TO TRY THE SHRIMP. Holy Sake, you have to try it. ;-) You get 5 for $14, but do not underestimate the shear size of these shrimp. They are meaty!!! 

The Cod was amazing, warmed up to perfection. The doughnut was so good! 

I don't know what they call it, but I tried these chicken pieces on a skewer. They were glazed with a tasty sauce and topped with sesame seeds = AMAZZZING. 

I then tried sushi with crab inside and a sweet slice of strawberry-love on top. It too was heavenly. 

I intend to go back soon with my Fiance who no doubt will love it. The decor is truly Japanese and it a lovely restaurant. Very romantic, not too big, but also not too small. 

I can't wait to go back!!!

Wouldn't it be just wonderful to know all of these reviews are a complete & accurate description of this place? Well, I've a review to write & this may sting a bit...but it is completely true & honest.
Yes, rabbits are wonderful pets & hoping to fill my bunny-void with more bunny-love I turned to Brambley...even drove out from Albuquerque (8-hrs away) After working with the staff for several weeks, completing much paperwork, I was ready to make the trip to meet Rosa-Marie for the first time. She was just 2 or 3 at the time. I brought her back to Albuquerque where she was a welcome addition to our family & a favorite of my daughters. She lived with us for about 5-yrs or so. 
Around Oct.'13 Rosa escaped from her hutch, through our fence gate which had blown open during high winds. This had never before occurred. She was subsequently hit by a car (my neighbor) who took her into the animal shelter. The animal shelter scanned her for a microchip & saw that she 'belonged' to Brambley Hedge Rabbit Rescue Group in AZ. Brambley phoned me at work & asked me where Rosa was. Of course I was beside myself confused; not only that after 5-yrs they were calling with such a silly question, but that her where-abouts were in question at all. They were very accusatory & rude to the point reluctantly providing me with any information on MY RABBIT of 5-yrs. I was finally able to speak to a manager who informed me on what occurred. I contacted the animal shelter & indicated i would be there immediately but upon arriving with my daughter was told they were stuck in the middle & could not give me back my injured rabbit. The director of animal services called Brambley & we discussed the matter via speakerphone. The words out of the mouth of Brambley was that they would hire an attorney & sue if Rosa left the facility. Nevermind she was lying in pain waiting with a mangled broken back leg & that I was ready to spend whatever it cost to get her well, nevermind my daughter sat there crying because this insane volunteer kept repeating that it was our fault Rosa was hurt...Nevermind she had been in our care in a superb environment with inside/outside home access for the past 5 YEARS. What it came down to was transfer of ownership and Brambley never made me the rightful owner, despite paying over $100 to 'adopt' her, the intention was to never do so. They still owned Rosa. They leased me a pet rabbit. Whoever heard of such a thing?! They decided she was not being properly cared for (despite this one-time freak accident). They decided they would come get her. I could not give the go-ahead for her necessary leg amputation. She lay waiting for days for this fanatical group to get their S*** in order and ultimately she ended up passing away during her surgery. The director of the animal shelter in Alb indicated her age had more to do with her passing but that laying around waiting did not help. He(director) also disclosed to me that this is not the first time such illogical, erratic, ignorant rescue group actions have benefitted noone. 
*****If you decide to "Adopt" from this crazy outfit, check that chip & make sure the animal is yours....you just may have a leased pet on your hands & they may decide to come get it after as many years, after you have grown attached to your new family member....Tragic for a 7-yr old & myself..
Shame on you Brambley~ for letting down an innocent rabbit who lay suffering waiting for someone to help her.

Best movie going experience period. The best movie theater reclining seats, which helps you fall asleep during a boring movie. Tickets are very reasonable $11/adult. However, this theater does not have that many screens, so whenever a popular movie comes out it's always sold out. Get your tickets online by reserving them ahead for time, it's an extra $1 fee. Also, parking might be hard to find on busy nights or you might have to park faraway.

Food service is also awesome. Their hotdogs and my favorite beer soaked bratwurst are amazing. If you are over 21 than you can enjoy nice bottle of wine or variety of beers. 

Overall(4/5), it the best movie going experience in my life. I would recommend getting their early or buy tickets online. I would also recommend the Green valley location over this one since its more cleaner.

My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. This place came highly recommended by my good yelp buddies (The Qs). The quality of food you get at this place is above some of the posh Italian joints on the strip. All the servers are extremely friendly and Chef Marc will personally stop by your table to educate everyone on his unique creations. I've been here twice and never been disappointed with any of the food I've ordered. 

The best thing about their pasta dishes is that pastas are freshly made and their sauces are unique to each variety of pasta dish to compliment it.  I also love their mushroom and spinach appetizer, its not on the menu sometimes, but every time I've asked for it they have made it for us. I would also recommend their Chicken Marsala, the sauce is just out of this world. 

The tasting courses offered at Parma are also exquisite. Chef Marc take a liberty on trying out new dishes that combine old Italian recipes with neo-American Italian style. Lot of these experimental dishes were featured in a yelp event that I went to. The best thing about this event was  the way Chef Marc educated uninformed foodies like me about the history and his childhood experience with particular Italian dishes and his versatile take on it. 

This is the best Italian food you'll have in Las Vegas and for the the quality of food and the service make this the best deal for the prices they are charging. Its great for any occasion. And its the best way to end my 2014 Yelp review line up.

Good restaurant if you are craving spicy seafood. First, do not wear nice clothes if you  are eating at Hot N Juicy. You are using your hands most of the time and the plastic bib can come of easily, so expect some splashed sauce on you clothing. I always go for their shrimp with Hot n Juicy sauce. The shrimps are fresh and huge. The sauce suites the the shrimp meat very well. I also love their seasoned fries. 

The quality of the food and service is exactly same as the Henderson location, but this place is more busy sometimes. You should check it out.

My favorite take out Chinese in the neighborhood. Their food is good and they have some healthy option with low sodium and oil. Also, they can make some really spicy mongolian beef. Trust me, if you want some good spicy food to sober up. This is where you should go.

You know my deal by now I hope!

Atmosphere: :D (biggest grin ever) - 'are you kidding me with this?!' - absolutely spectacular ambiance! it's must must visit (granted you can bear the wait to get a table!) yes it is that good.  My absolute favourite tea house in Montreal - these folks do it right!!! 

Added bonus, they kindly suggest  - via sign on each table - that no electronic devices should be used, and as such visitors adhere to this out of respect for others and the quite ambiance that is in play.  It's great to unplug from the world here!

Food: An wonderful selection of teas (type / geography).  Well over 50 kinds of teas are on the menu for direct consumption and the store itself (open during the day) has much much more that you can buy! They sell tea paraphernalia as well - which is just minty :D

Service: A+ and bonus points to add! The folks working here are top top notch.  Kind, generous with their time, and make a signed effort to explain things (how to order the teas, how to pour, where each tea is from and its qualities).  It shows to a great extent how much they love what they do.  Honesty one of the best places to observe good service in Montreal. Classy classy people.

No ifs, ands, or buts - just go - trust me on this!  Your zen will thank you :)

I cannot believe they did not have oxtails on the buffet.  I came here on steak night so maybe that was the reason. Visually this place is very nice.  It has been rated as one of the best value buffet's in Las Vegas and it still is.  They cater to Hawaiians and this makes the food here very exotic to a Midwestern guy.  Fired chicken, to pulled pork and everything in between.  Good salad bar good Italian, Asian, and down home.  They had turnip greens on the buffet and they were great.  They also have an extensive dessert area I don;'t do sugar but they did look good.  I checked out the bread pudding for Stephanie in case she eats here and she will be happy.

Looking for a quick bite or looking for a place to eat late at night?  Find this secret pizza place at the cosmopolitan!  It's next to the sushi restaurant with the pool table close by. You see a small entrance way and the hall takes you to the pizza place. It's really small. You can call in your order or order there. You can order by the slice or a whole pie. The pizza slices are pretty big. 

I was doing meatless Friday the day I tried it out. I ended up just getting a cheese pizza, but it was super good cheese pizza!  I wish I tried the mushrooms. 

The pizza boxes are nifty. If you have leftovers (like half a pie), you can tear off the top part of the box and fold the bottom of the box to save some room :)

I'll be back!

My husband and I stopped by here while waiting for our flight on Southwest. This Popeyes is located in the C terminal. There is plenty of seating, however, we were here on a Saturday evening which wasn't too busy.  

We got a popcorn shrimp combo. The shrimp was freshly cooked and so crisp and yummy!  And fries didn't taste that fresh. The biscuit was good. They don't have any fountain water so if you need water, you need to buy a bottle. 

Workers were nice and making jokes. I'd eat here again of I'm at the airport. I literally said out loud that it was delicious!

At first, I thought I was going to have a great experience here.  They had great items ranging from wines to great decor for the biggest alcoholic and wine enthusiast in the city; however, my night was completely spoiled by the extremely rude and unpleasant ladies who were working.

As a newly turned 21 year old, I have grown accustom to showing my ID, and I do not mind doing it one bit.  I know the law, and I would never risk a business being fined by serving an underager.  However the ladies were extremely rude when demanding I show ID first before even looking at a wine.  Then, after showing my ID to the one nice ladies, the others looked over and saw me drinking and lost her mind.  She was obviously too busy with her computer to see I had already been carded.  Her redundancy about the fines that would be given if they served me underage were rather annoying and uneccasary.  

Too bad the staff was so rude because we were about to buy some wine and a few decorations.

Stellar spot for a nice, special dinner. No hoodies if you get my drift yet no bowties either. Casual elegance. The staff was friendly, attentive & kept the right amount of distance. So what did we eat? 
Simple spaghetti with tomato, basil and fresh ricotta. 
Market fish (salmon) sitting on an orzo-like grain with olives and tomato.
Cannoli to finish. The chef served us two to try, one vanilla and one chocolate. He wanted our opinion on which was tastier. We were more than willing to be the guinea pigs. A sweet surprise.

More than adequate staffing level at present, all chefs/cooks visible in the kitchen speak Japanese, the menu is possibly unique here in Las Vegas (aside from the sister restaurant Kabuki).  The minimalistic ambiance of this small restaurant just works for me. And if you want to photo-document your meal, sit at the "pasta bar" counter, the lighting there is adequate for simple food photography needs.

So Down to business.  A group of Yelpers were actually at the plaza where this new restaurant is located at last night (Monday), which is currently their only day off.  So I decided I was going to check them out the next evening after work.  As the chef, possibly the owner, handed us their business cards and a few menu (he was at the restaurant with a few others).

When I arrived at 7:30pm on Tuesday, the place had 4 tables occupied already, and I am pretty sure that everyone there, except yours truly, was a native Japanese.  I considered that a positive indicator for seeking authentic Japanese style rendition of Western cuisine.

The menu is pretty simple, pastas are on the specials board, while appetizers,salads, chef's special dishes are on a 2-sided menu. The dessert menu also offers some Western desserts with a Japanese twist. Menu prices are mostly in the $teens, but can quickly add up to a meal costing $30-40+ per person.

On my inaugural visit, I tried the Miso Carbonara for main course #1 and Kurobuta Tonkatsu "Nakamura-Ya" Style for main course #2.  

The  Miso Carbonara pasta dish was good, the flavor is obviously different from traditional Italian Carbonara pasta dishes, but the sauce was creamy with a mild flavor.  I personally would prefer the pieces of bacon to be cooked a bit more, but that is a personal preference of mine.  Check out the picture I posted if you are interested in trying out this item. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA?select=eSNQvL3QRJTT66ztOZ2-QQ
Flavor: 3.5 stars. Presentation: 3.5 stars. Value: 3 stars.

Since I was still hungry, I went and ordered the Kurobuta Tonkatsu "Nakamura-Ya" Style from the Chef's Special Dishes portion of the menu.  It is a very delicious and juicy tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) that is served with a tomato sauce, an asparagus, watercress, a button mushroom cut upand awedgeoflemon as garnish.  The only thing I thought was missing was a starch component to the entree, like rice pilaf or something.  Then again, maybe the roll that is served with the meal is meant to serve that role.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA?select=C-6NKQW_7vs5xV_GZMd9lA
Flavor: 5 stars. Presentation: 3 stars.  Value: 3 stars.

For dessert I had the Soy Milk Panna Cotta "Okinawa Black Sugar" Sauce for $5.95, but the Black Sesame Blanc Manger also looks very interesting on the menu.  The Panna Cotta was pretty good, I like the flavor, although the texture seems a bit firmed (like too much gelatin was used) to me. However, the Okinawa Black Sugar Sauce was the key component that makes this dessert.  The dessert is probably prepared by savory chefs, as some basic pastry chef attention to detail was amissed (utilized sprig of mint that had clear signs of pest feeding on the leaf as a very noticeable garnish just seems careless, and something that can easily be prevented). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA?select=o1ILKDTRwUZ9t6x3W5KJfg

Anyway, I like this new addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene, and can see myself paying the occasional visit when I am in the mood.

Location: In the same plaza as Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Won, Soul Oak Korean BBQ.  Very accessible if you are near the Chinatown area.

Parking:  3/5  Could easily gets crowded, but not filled to capacity where you have to look for nearby street parking.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  I like the execution of the interior decor and the lighting (dim in the main dining area, and well lite at the "pasta bar"counter.

Service:  4.5/5  Pleasant service by a small squad of friendly waitresses.

Value:  3.5/5  Not a cheap meal, but I do think you get what you pay for, plus there is not much competition for this kind of cuisine in Las Vegas at the moment.

Flavor:  4 stars overall, some dishes and items are executed better than others.  But the balance of flavor that is not too overpowering, and compliments the components of the dish is what will make you go back for more.

4 stars!  Bravo and welcome to Las Vegas Trattoria Nakamura-Ya!!!

Note:  They do accept AMEX.

I personally would prefer the pieces of bacon to be cooked a bit more, but that is a personal preference of mine.  Check out the picture I posted if you are interested in trying out this item. Flavor: 3.5 stars. Presentation: 3.5 stars. Value: 3 stars.

Since I was still hungry, I went and ordered the Kurobuta Tonkatsu "Nakamura-Ya" Style from the Chef's Special Dishes portion of the menu.  It is a very delicious and juicy tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) that is served with a tomato sauce, an asparagus and a button mushroom cut up as garnish.  The only thing I thought was missing was a starch component to the entree, like rice pilaf or something.  Then again, maybe the roll that is served with the meal is meant to serve that role.  Flavor: 5 stars. Presentation: 3 stars.  Value: 3 stars.

For dessert I had the Soy Milk Panna Cotta "Okinawa Black Sugar" Sauce for $5.95, but the Black Sesame Blanc Manger also looks very interesting on the menu.  The Panna Cotta was pretty good, I like the flavor, although the texture seems a bit firmed (like too much gelatin was used) to me. However, the Okinawa Black Sugar Sauce was the key component that makes this dessert.  The dessert is probably prepared by savory chefs, as some basic pastry chef attention to detail was amissed (utilized sprig of mint that had clear signs of pest feeding on the leaf as a very noticeable garnish just seems careless, and something that can easily be prevented). 

Anyway, I like this new addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene, and can see myself paying the occasional visit when I am in the mood.

Location: In the same plaza as Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Won, Soul Oak Korean BBQ.  Very accessible if you are near the Chinatown area.

Parking:  3/5  Could easily gets crowded, but not filled to capacity where you have to look for nearby street parking.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  I like the execution of the interior decor and the lighting (dim in the main dining area, and well lite at the "pasta bar"counter.

Service:  4.5/5  Pleasant service by a small squad of friendly waitresses.

Value:  3.5/5  Not a cheap meal, but I do think you get what you pay for, plus there is not much competition for this kind of cuisine in Las Vegas at the moment.

Flavor:  4 stars overall, some dishes and items are executed better than others.  But the balance of flavor that is not too overpowering, and compliments the components of the dish is what will make you go back for more.

4 stars!  Bravo and welcome to Las Vegas Trattoria Nakamura-Ya!!!

Note:  They do accept AMEX.

Just stopped by here quickly today to grab some food to go for my grandmother. She loves this place! I was greeted warmly by Norma the hostess who quickly helped me get my grandmas order on the way. 

When I went to the bar to pay a very kind lady with pig tails asked if I wanted to have a seat and enjoy some water or tea as I waited. I politely declined but was very grateful that she asked. Between her and the hostess my quick trip to Mimi's was great and because of their service I will be back to dine in with them in the near future. 

Thank you lovely folks at Mimi's.

IMO there is nothing better than a beautiful early morning hike.  Cholla trail definitely delivered.

The degree of difficulty will vary obviously depending on your hiking experience, fitness level and personal preference of which type of hike you enjoy. 

With that being said, I don't believe Cholla Trail is easier than Echo Canyon.  The hike is could be considered easier if you stop at the heli pad.  If you continue to the top of the summit where Echo Canyon and Cholla meet then it is significantly more challenging.  

Echo Canyon is no walk in the park but I would recommend it over the Cholla Trail for those new to hiking or not as experienced.

Recently stayed at The Signature for my recent trip to Vegas for the Maypac fight. I have stayed here before. I find it quiet, and relaxing, with an upscale a apartment feel. We had the 1 bedroom suite , 17th floor, tower 2. The room was very clean, with a good homey feeling. The Signature is connected to the MGM , which is great location wise. But, be prepared for a long long walk when going to the MGM which you will probably do daily. I would definitely stay here again, it's quiet, no casino, no loud partying. Allows you to sleep after a long Vegas day.

I recently visited Vegas, for the MayPac fight . My husband I went to Tap our second day there. They had a wait, which was understandable due to the large amount of people in the MGM. The wait was only about 15 minutes or so, oppose to the 30min the hostess had stated. Upon being seated, we weren't very satisfied with the table, it was right by the window where people were waiting to be seated. We asked to be moved. The hostess was very nice, and moved us immediately. Once moved, our waitress came by and took our drink orders. When she returned, we ordered our food. We didn't order anything major, Tap Nachos w/chicken, and beef sliders. The waitress left, she was gone for about 20 minutes, we started to notice people that were seated after us were already enjoying their meals. I was starting to get a little annoyed....... Then another waitress showed up and introduced herself! We were confused, and asked "where was the other waitress?" She informed us, that she was off, and going home! I then asked about our order, she informed us that it had been put in by the previous waitress. Ok........ We were now hitting the 45 minute mark, and guess who comes back to our table? The very first waitress that was supposed be gone for the day! Wow! I immediately told her that we had been informed that she was gone for the day, she snapped back responding that she hadn't left yet because she was waiting on our food! Really..... Lol, she walks away, we get up and leave. Wasted a whole hour of my Vegas trip!
      So believe it or not, 2 days later, we gave TAP another try. This time was much better. Very nice waitress, we actually received food and service. We pretty much ordered the same thing, but I ordered Chilli instead of Chicken on my nachos. When the food arrived, it looked great. My nachos were awesome, big portion, great Chilli and cheese combo. My husbands burger sliders look great too, with big homemade fries. Only one thing, the meat was medium rare. We informed the waitress, and she stated she told us that was how they are prepared. Only problem is that he wanted them well done,and That option was never offered. The waitress took them back, and had them prepared to his liking. Once they came back, they were great. I guess I would go again, it's convenient if you are staying at the MGM , and has very nice sporty atmosphere.

It's inside Baiz market. I got the lamb kabob plate it's only  $8.99. It comes with great hummus, onion, pickle, tomatoes, and a amazing yellow Jasmine rice. Two pitas come as a side. You can bring your own bottle of water or buy one here. Chicken has been dry a few times so I only order it in a sand which which has a sauce on it. 
If you like to travel take a look around the market and it will make you feel like you are in a distant land. I love the candies and butcher shop area. It's another world!

If you have checked out my Yelp profile, you'd see that I'm a vegan who travels quite frequently.  And when I travel, I eat a lot of vegan food!

Therefore ... I think that I am quite qualified to say that Green makes the BEST VEGAN BURGER in the world.  

You got it ... best vegan burger IN THE WORLD.

And do you know which burger I speak of?  It is the glorious Big Wac (with extra Wac sauce).  

I have made the pilgrimage to both Green locations for several years now, and the Big Wac is always amazing and still has yet to be beat.  

And for you McDonald's lovers, my friend says this burger tastes like a real Big Mac (I've never had one in my life, so I can't confirm).  So just try it.  And if you're flying to Chicago from Arizona, please bring one back for me!!!

Why hello, common market, and look at your stellar craft beer selection! 

I must say, common market is an amazing local staple. Half of the fun is educating yourself on the astute choices of brews to choose from. You just seem to feel like branching out and trying a micro/craft brew that you've never heard of before. Or, for the hipster at heart, grab a PBR and join the crowd. Their selection varies, so be sure to check back for seasonals and different locales to be featured/available.

I love the giant drums of beer and glass bottled coke throughout the shop as well. Makes it feel less like grocery-esque for a quick grab n' go. 

The deli is a phenomenon. Friendly for the typical sandwich aficionado and the vegan/veggie types. The flavors and combinations are endless and the deft hands of the deli staff move the lines faster than other places. 

Gotta love the niche humor and accessories/toys for sale. Always good for a gag gift or oddly celebrated white elephant party in July. 

Something for everyone here. Grab a six pack to go, a draught with friends or snackage for the road. 

Never a dull moment for this plaza midwood hearth. Always a pleasure to visit.

Goodness gracious, do I love Lupie's. 

This place is a Charlotte staple for sure. Talk about a great dive with tons of history. 

Nice and simple menu with a couple choices of burgers and a few different kinds of chili. Let me say, the chili is what will keep you coming back. The choices are variations of Cincinnati, Southern and Texas style Chili. All have their strong points and are even good when mixed together. The only one I can't truly appreciate is the Cincinnati style. Sweetness in my chili is just a bit weird as a dyed in the wool southerner. 

Sweet tea. You've gotta get Lupie's sweet tea. Sweetened to perfection and they give it to you in a mason jar with the best crushed ice in the world. A perfect pairing for your chili of choice. 

The burgers are great, too. I haven't ventured into the world of burgers too much, but what I've had has been memorable. 

The parking lot can be a little tricky. If you're going at peak lunch hours, good luck. It's a bit cutthroat to find a space. Also, getting back out on to Monroe can be a bit of a challenge, so beware. 

This place is awesome. Love it for lunch or a date night with my wife. Actually went to this place with wife the night we decided to get married! Such a great memory. 

Keep doing exactly what you've been doing all these years, Lupies. 

Perfect.

Love me some Bad Daddy's! 

The homemade chips are one of the items that keeps me coming back and looking forward to having a lunch meeting at either location. 

The burgers/sandwiches are great. Nice portion of beef or other sandwich-friendly insides. Not your run-of-the-mill burger. Definitely some of the better combinations out there. The Mama Ricotta burger is awesome and different and the Cantina 1511 is a knockout. Love green chilies on a burger!

The wings fit well on the "expected" side when it comes to flavor. Nothing groundbreaking. Also, a little disappointed that you can't order an entree-sized portion. They only come in a 7-8 count as an app. Kinda lame. What if I wanted 15? Too bad, brosef. 

The only downside is their veggie burger. Not a huge fan of the texture. It's a little mealy and tends to fall apart. Definitely had better.

The milkshakes are bangin. Aaaaand you can get it SPIKED! So good. I had never tried a spiked milkshake, let alone heard of one, until I had gone to Bad Daddy's. Seriously worth a try. Better off splitting one of these bad boys (pun intended). It comes with some extra in the spin cup for your further sugar/dairy laden enjoyment. 

Outdoor seating is phenomenal and you really can't go wrong on a spring day on East Blvd while being outside. The hightop communal tables at East Blvd cause a bit of a backup/walking issues. Beware if you are trying to get out while its busy. 

Service is always friendly and fast. These guys are doing a great job with their entire chain of restaurants across the Queen City. Hats off, ladies and gents. 

Great Charlotte staple. Perfect place for 2, family, with kids or whatever.

Not much of a salad guy, but this place is a salad lover's Mecca. 

Anything you want. Huge bowl. Lots of stuff. 

They do an amazing job with their grilled tofu and shrimp, too. Love the flavor. 

Not too keen on their beverages or their bread/side options. 

The tomato basil soup is a little on the bland side.

Make sure you're there when the cook who owns the salt shaker shows up. 

Love sitting outside though. Great place to eat at sunset. 

If you're the evening workout type, this is a an awesome place to grab something light before you head back home. 

I recommend the Chinese Shrimp Salad. Great combo of smokey, grilled shrimp and mandarin oranges.

Overall and Elizabeth staple for a quick and healthy lunch.

I have never been treated so rudely in my life. This is the outside bar at the Fairmont Princess near the pool. First off we were there for a work function after a hard day learning, our bosses treated to dinner at True food up the street. We came back to the hotel and all wanted to go on the waterslides at the pool and jaccuzzi. We were told the pool with the waterslides closed at 10, we managed to dart over at 9:30 in our bathing suits and cover ups on 3 of us, 1 had no cover up. We got to the pool and it was sad it actually closed at 5. So the staff misinformed us. We were told the other pool with the jaccuzzi was open all night. We opted to grab a cocktail then head over to the jaccuzzi.

 All of us looked beautiful. I guess that is a problem at this bar NO HOT CHICKS in bathing suits. If that was a problem they should have told us there was a dress code. No one said a peep about our attire. But it was near 78 degrees and near the pool. No one said anything except all the old douchey men oogling us who stopped paying attention to their drunk girlfriends when we walked in. Several mad dogged me immediately and were making snide remarks which I ignored, while we waited for the bartender to come over which seemed like forever. 

I told the ladies 'maybe we should not be here in bathing suits here' they said no it was fine. Anyway immediately guys were buying us shots (blow jobs to be exact) I passed mine to some guy next to me. I don't like them and felt it was an insult... Another douchebag guy comes up immediately and says "my friend will give you $20 bucks to see if your friends tits are real" REALLY? This is the Fairmont crowd? WOW.

 Then after we just get our drinks some other betch who was making nasty remarks when we were ordering came over and asked to buy pot off us. Do we LOOK like drug dealers? In our bikinis no less? We blew her off and she went back to her friends who all proceeded to heckle us. Another obviously highly inebriated hag comes over and tells my friend to put her boobs away and something else I will not repeat. The drunk woman then goes to management points to us and the woman manager Tamara was her name I think.

Tamara (or Tanya) comes over with a large black bouncer and says 'I am going to have to ask you you leave" I was like 'excuse me? For what?" She says "you are all intoxicated and you have to go". I said we JUST got here check our bar tabs we have ordered ONE drink. We are paying guests at the hotel" She say says "Nope you are drunk you have to leave you are inebriated I say 'NO we are not drunk, how so? This is our first drink! I am NOT leaving check our bar tab we have only had one drink and I am finishing my drink." She turns to the bouncer and says "remove them now". I was like WTF? 'Touch me and we are gonna have issues".
 
I Iook over and the drunk betch is pointing and laughing and flips us off. The bartender agrees to refund one of my coworkers drinks who had just ordered and recieved a second drink if we leave. The rest of us had finished our drinks prepared to leave because of how douchey the whole scene was, and head to the pool. None of us had prior cocktails we were at a work dinner prior and a conference all day. This was ridiculous it was jealous drunk customers lying to the staff and they did not even TRY to investigate the situation.

Bottom line $11 for a bitter well drink and the management needs to be SERIOUSLY removed. I will NEVER come back to this hotel again. We spent several thousand dollars on accommodations this behavior was appalling and if it's any indication of how they now treat hotel guests well ALL Fairmonts are now OFF the list.

This is a great local little coffee shop located in a strip mall with some sort of a Zumba place next to it. It was thumping from the music of class next door when I got my coffee. Combined with the coffee shop music the two music's together were a little bit overwhelming for me first thing in the morning.

 I'm glad I found a mom and pop type place close to my work. The large mocha was delicious and strong. I think it was $5. I honestly was sleepy and didn't remember. 
I was humming around all day from it!

I love all the local art for sale. They had some pottery and jewelry for sale from local artists as well.

They have a really good iced coffee too. I wish they would get a coconut milk substitute but most places don't unfortunately.

 Still I'm a fan!

One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.

So - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.

The guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.

We went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.

Next stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)

Results - 
     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.
          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~
     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.
          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~
     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.
          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.

So, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.  I can't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be!

My first International Supper Club!
I think we overwhelmed the kitchen - everything was just a bit off.

Granted - it's not a huge restaurant - and I think having a group of 20 something people arrive and order at once would throw any small, independent restaurant off. 

Service was as friendly as could be - but it is difficult for 2 servers to handle 20 hungry and thirsty patrons. Arrival of dinners was poorly spaced - by the time the last person got her plate, the first people were done. Sides and tortillas came very late. The food itself was somewhere between decent and good. I have no complaints, but wasn't really wowed by anything I tried.

I can see the diamond in the rough quality here - and I have friends that love it - so I will be back with just a small group (4 tops) to see what a "normal" dinner is like.

*Happy Hour Review*
(This is at the Mix Up Bar - and I will post there, too - but it seems many don't know it's separate from T. Cooks, so I am reviewing here.)

Three words: Duck Confit Poutine - rich, delicious, large portion. The name says it all - and my pictures do not do it any justice!

Three more words: Lobster Corn Dogs - small plate with only 3 pieces - but incredibly well prepared, delicious and hey - lobster for $5.00!?!

Three more words: Half price bourbon! Two incredibly well crafted and incredibly generous Manhattans later, I was feeling no pain!

One of the best parts of PHX is the under-appreciated happy hour deals at some of our best resorts. Especially this time of year - there are great values to be had, at incredible prices!

Here's the Mix Up current specials menu:
Daily - happy hour 4-7; $5.00 cocktails, beer, wine and lite bites.
Tuesdays - Pizza & Punch $5 flatbreads, $6 signature punch cocktail of the day: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.
Women & Whiskey Wednesdays - 1/2 price ladies bourbon night: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.
Bourbon & Burgers Thursdays - $8 burger, 1/2 price bourbons: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.

.Can't wait to go back!

Come for the view, of course!
The NYC cousins stayed at the Pointe for their very brief visit to Phoenix. Upon check in, they made reservations for 5 of us for Saturday night.
Logistically, we were a pain in the ass. Five diners, one table. Between one and three courses ordered per person. NOT an easy job to pace that one!
Mom had the lobster bisque and lobster entree. One cousin had the lobster bisque, a salad, and the special oyster app. Other cousin had a salad and scallop entree. Mom's husband just ordered the scallop entree. And I had the blood orange salad and Berkshire pork belly app.
Service was impressive...plates were staggered in a way that it seemed we always had food in front of us, but never felt rushed.
All the food was fresh and tasty, and beautifully presented. 
Personally, I am thrilled with how many places pork belly is showing up these days. My hips are not happy, but my taste buds talk louder! :)
Of course - the sun goes down, the Valley lights come on - and you remember why you're willing to pay insane prices. No matter how good the food is, no matter how good the service - you are paying for the view. And it is worth it!
(That's not the double Maker's on the rocks talking!)

A Brazilian wax on Groupon brought me and a friend to a salon in Bethel Park. Marissa was the Esthetician and made our experience a really great one!

The procedure is quite uncomfortable, to say the least, but Marissa talked with me the whole time about school, work, relationships, etc. We were even talking about some intimate details of our lives even though we barely knew each other. But once you're bearing it all to see you kind of hit a new level of intimacy with someone upon meeting them.

Afterwards I had no ingrown hairs and the wax lasted a good six weeks. She recently moved to Sybil Salon and even sent me a text message to notify me. I never want anyone else to wax my woman parts as long as I can help it!

Thanks Marissa!

I liked this theater!! There is a parking lot nearby that is free after 6 pm. There is additional seating in the balcony, which has sofas!! They sell standard concessions and it is byob- there are probably a half dozen bars within a 5 block radius so grabbing a 6 pack is convenient! The bathrooms were large and clean.

It is certainly not gourmet pizza but you don't pay $20 for the pizza either.

Always fast service and pizza is warm and ready on the spot.

I only go here for one reason and one reason only, their $6.99 steak special. It honestly doesn't get any better than this for $6.99. I refuse to pay $12-$20 for a steak dinner at places like TGIF and Chili's now, knowing that I can go to Ellis and have BETTER quality for a lower price. Don't get me wrong, i'd still pay for a steak at Ruth's Cris and higher end establishments, but for the lower-midrange establishments you won't find a better steak deal. You get sourdough rolls to start, then your choice of soup or salad, and then the entree. A Nice steak cooked to order with garlic sauteed green beans and your choice of mashed potatoes& gravy or baked potato. 

I'll have to try the BBQ there since everyone says its good. I'll update when I do.

I wanted to give four stars but I couldnt.

The weekday lunch specials are always the same five items in the same sequence.  Tuesday is enchiladas verdes.  I ordered the special.  I substitute rice for all beans on the side.

They charge too much for extras.  Carry out costs and addition .30, that is 5% hike on the special.  I wanted extra verde sauce on the enchiladas but they wanted another $1.  That is over 16% price increase.  Most other places will give you some extra cheese, sour cream, or sauce for free so long as it already comes with the entree in some quantity.

I eat here every week and the quality differs greatly.  Two weeks ago the chicken enchiladas had huge chunks of unseasoned chicken, this week is was orange with seasoning but very stringy.

I wish it was a bit more consistent and that they didn't charge you for all the extras (carry out being one of those extras).  They have coupons but you have to buy two drinks so in the end it is basically a coupon for free drinks.  You will never save a dime on your entrees.

Don't shop here - GO TO A CORPORATE VERIZON STORE.

I had my worst retail experience in my entire life at this store.  I should say that again, I am not exaggerating: my worst retail experience in my entire life.

I agree with the previous review of this store.  I dealt with Byron Huskins and he cancelled my order for iPhone 6 Plus phones without even telling me.  I only found out when I called to pickup my phones that although they had arrived I was not going to be allowed to leave the store with them.  The order wasn't really cancelled, the phones were there but Byron didn't want me ever getting them.

I elevated this issue to the manager (he manages several of these stores throughout Charlotte, he said "you are not going to leave the store with these phones."

The employees outright lie to you, you think they couldn't do that.  I was told if i didn't like it I should hire an attorney.  They dared me to sue them.  They have a devil may care attitude.

When someone acts with impunity and uses the cliche to sue them if you don't like it, you know you are in peril as a customer.

If you cancel your contract within 6 months of starting your order this store will charge you for the purchase price of your smartphone, you will still owe Verizon Wireless $350, but this store could charge you up to $800 more on top of that.  They also have higher prices on the phones than a corporate store so you if you cancel you will pay more than if you walked into a Verizon Wireless corporate store and outright bought a phone without a contract at full ticket.  If you order a phone from a Verizon Wireless corporate store you can get the phone for the subsidized price, cancel the contract the next day and only pay the $350.

These people are terrible and the deals are worse.  There are many more reasons to never shop here.  My experience was the worst and as a result I have hatred, that is a very strong emotion to get from trying to buy something.

(I dealt with 3 of these stores, 2 in person and 1 on the phone).

Don't go here.

People park here and aren't actually getting gas.  If you look around this is more expensive gas than any other station int he area.

There is a giant pothole just outside the station and you could easily mess up your rims or an axle if you hit it.

I live right near here and I no longer go here because I have had to wait to get to a pump on every occasion.  Who hangs out at a gas station?  Apparently everyone that does decides this is the one gas station to just hang out at.

This place is also scary: someone tried to sell me jewelry and bootleg CDs, I didn't know if it was a windup to getting assaulted or mugged.  I was scared and the guy was being very aggressive and standing too close.  Ladies watch out for this place.

Eh... I'm rounding up from what really is a 2.5 star review. If you really need a lower cost hotel, it's a weekend where there is a big event in town or a holiday weekend and you forgot to book something till the last minute, or everywhere else just has crazy proves, (both true in my case) then this hotel is alright for a night.

It's not far from the Strip, so that's a plus. But the casino is old and smokey, the halls are smelly and dirty (we saw someone's leftover room service outside of their door all day, night, and into the next morning), and there are lots of people using it as an extended stay motel- full families with cribs.

We were able to get an updated room, and it was actually pretty decent, aside from the bathroom, which did not look like it got the benefit of the update. The shower didn't have fantastic water pressure, but at least the water got hot enough. Beds were just fine.

If you meet the above criteria, then Silver Sevens is ok, and you could do worse. In other circumstances, you're better off booking elsewhere.

A pretty good spot if you are in the mood for some Mediterranean food in Downtown Summerlin. The location is bright and airy, and has an outdoor seating area as well. Everything is made to order, so after you place your order, you'll get a table number and your meal will be brought to you. All in all, it took perhaps 10 minutes.

The pitas are served with an order of fries, which aren't really that necessary or remarkable. I actually wished that I could order my pita separately, as with the fries the cost was $8.99. (if they had an option for gyro-only for about $6.50, that would be perfect!).  There were large chunks of meat, feta cheese, olives, and cucumber within. It was very tasty, but be careful of those big meat chunks! Although tender enough, I almost choked on one because of the size.

The restaurant itself was pleasant, but I wasn't crazy about the fact that the bathrooms are located right next to the trash cans, in a small corridor, and they were 1-stall rest rooms. I can see that at busy times, there might be quite a line. They also were already showing signs of use and could have been better maintained. 

All in all, it was a good dining experience, so I hope that they do well!

Take your business elsewhere! Don't go through the pain and suffering I went through. Chase took about 5 years off of my life. 

I made the mistake of  using Chase as my mortgage lender, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever endured. Robert Page, my mortgage lender, said that we would close on October 16th. Then he pushed it back until October 18th. Then he pushed it back until October 21st citing some ridiculous reason. Of course, we couldn't close on the 21 because of another ridiculous reason, so Robert pushed it back until October 25th. You see the trend? Then, we were supposed to close on October 28th....which didn't happen either. If you can't close on a certain date, then don't make a promise. It's that easy! I would have been much happier if you told me from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to close until October 29th...in which case I could have chosen a different lender.The situation got so bad that I had to reach out to Robert's boss, David Campbell. He said he would "take care of us" which is also another broken promise. In an effort to rectify the situation, Chase promised to reimburse us for the rent we had to pay when we couldn't move in on October 16th. Of course, they reneged on that as well.

If you love being lied to, then Chase is the way to go for your mortgage! I had a terrible experience getting a mortgage at Chase. I had to call multiple managers at Chase before anything was done. They reimbursed me about $1000 for all the headache and bad information they gave me. $1000 seems like a lot, but they should have given us at least $3,000 back for deceiving us. 

If I could go back, I would have gone to a federal credit union for my mortgage.

*restaurant/Bar only*

So, Gallo Blanco, the popular restaurant that opened a few years ago and was debuted in the cover of Phoenix magazine during their 25 Best new restaurants, stopped operating in the Clarendon Hotel.  However, a modern Mexican restaurant does operate in its place and is doing a very fine job.

I have stopped in here for drinks and come for a couple meals since GB closed.  My favorite thing on that menu has to be the other-worldly delicious flapjacks!  Oh my word.  Those things taste better than any pancake I have ever had in my life.  

I had a few custom crafted cocktails and the bartenders did a pretty good job with my list of favorite ingredients.

The roof top is a nice place to hang out and have a cocktail.  

The pool area is adorable and the last time I was there at 11pm, folks were still hanging out there.  If you like the boutique hotels of south beach... You will enjoy this one too.

I can't believe I've never written a review of this place. 

I think they have delicious food.  I wish their calamari were better.  But the other items I've had on the menu are tasty.  I had no idea they had a formal dining room or a private dining room.  I've ALWAYS only gone to the Lounge.  The atmosphere in the lounge is usually energetic and fun.  THere is an outside patio if you like sitting outside.

I have gone here on weekend nights to hear live soul music and to dance.  The crowd is a 30+ crowd and I personally love that, since I am 30+.  :-)  I have been for HH and for the later hours for the band.  I think they have great HH offerings from the appetizer menu and for the drink menu. 

The service here has ALWAYS been top flight and top class.  I've never been disappointed with the quality of service here.  My only complaint about this establishment is that it is in Ahwatukee and not in a more central location.

This is a review that has been in the making for quite some time.  This review is for the THIS location.  This is a 3.5 Star review, but I can't give them a 3.

I will cut to the chase and save most of my comments for the Phoenix/Original location.  LoLo's is down right good chicken and great waffles.

This location seems to not be as busy as the flagship location in downtown.  But, please don't think that means that this location is not busy.  At lunch time, if you arrive before noon or after 1:30, you will stand your best chance to be seated right away.  On the weekends, fa'git about it, you'll wait.  its worth it. 

I order the exact same thing Every time I go.  I rarely change my order.  I order a Tre Tre with blue koolaid.  When I first started going, they didn't have the blue koolaid, so I ordered the red koolaid.  On a couple of occasions, I was feeling snazzy, so I ordered the Toy Toy.  The Tre  Tre is similar to the Toy Toy.  Both have 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle.  Tre Tre - Drumsticks.  Toy Toy - Wings.  The chicken is hot and crispy.  I have had it a time or two and thought that perhaps it had been cooked and sitting in a warmer too long.  The waffles are extremely good.  I enjoy putting a little of the butter and a lot of the syrup on mine and eating my waffle from the inside out!  YUMMY!   I haven't had much else on the menu, but I've sampled the plates of folks I've been with and their food was good.  I was in there a couple of weeks ago and I see that they have added several new items to the menu.  I want to try the shrimp and grits.

The thing about this location that I like is that the service is always friendly and prompt.  This is the only place in Phoenix for chicken and waffles.  I love being waited on by a couple of guys that work there.  they are twins.  Mr C and Mr D (if I recall correctly).  Those are some nice fellas.

I have tried their Red Velvet Cake and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was a decent contender for what I would call a good Red Velvet Cake.  It doesn't rival my 1st and 2nd favorite RVC's in phoenix.  The texture of this cake is exactly moist enough and the cream cheese icing tastes creamy and sweet.  The one thing their RVC is missing is the taste of the cake.  The hint of the chocolate is not there.  I DO NOT like the raw nuts on the cake, but I can eat around that.  

All in all, LoLo's is the "only" spot to get  chicken and waffles in Phoenix.

Went here today because I missed the OCT 2015 International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (UYE).  Norm R was right.  This place has the best Pho in Phoenix. 

This place is situated in a nondescript strip mall of Asian inspired shops.  I have literally passed it a dozen times and have never noticed it.  

it looks like a bingo hall on the inside with these tables with numbers on them.  Fluorescent lights lining the drop ceiling and rectangle folding (-like) tables with 6 or 8 chairs at most of them.

The Pho is relatively inexpensive.  I didn't realize, ordering the oxtail Pho, that I was ordering one of the most expensive things on the menu at $12.  I am one of those weirdos who order Pho for the broth and the beef.  I'm indifferent about the noodles and rarely eat much of them.  The broth here is the best I've had in Phoenix.   This was a warm treat on a chilly rainy day. 

The place was packed too.  I was surprised, but then maybe not.  It was a rainy cool day in PHoenix.  Who wants to be out?  Apparently others had the same thoughts as I, let's get Pho!

Ok, I'd forgotten about this restaurant.  They moved a while ago from their SoScott location (that may have been in Tempe) on McKellips.  So I basically forgot about them.  I was searching for this restaurant on Yelp/Google after a discussion about my taste in MX food.  Come to find out, when Huauchinango reopened in the new location, the person that submitted this business page on Yelp spelled the name wrong!  So my search would turn up nothing on Google and Yelp.  I figured the resto was out of business.  Then like magic, another Yelper mentioned it in Yelp Talk.  I caught the misspell by a Yelper today and searched on that and bam... IN BUSINESS!

Yes, this is some really good food from a bonafide-hole-in-the-wall joint.  Makes me wanna do the happy dance when I used to eat their tamales.  So of course, after finding them in the search today, via a Yelper mention, I knew I had to go here tonight!  I'd waited for 2 years!  

No tamales as they were out and would be making more for the next morning.  I will return soon for the tamales.  I'll stop in for lunch this time or, call ahead to make sure they have them.  So, no tamale tonight --- that's ok, I stuffed my face with a couple tacos.  I had the carnitas and the beef tongue tacos.  Both delicious and yummy.  I ordered chicken enchiladas for lunch tomorrow.   In true pig-out fashion, I took a bite of that and the enchiladas are far better than I remembered them being when they were on McKellips.  Just the right amount of salt-ness with enchilada sauce and cheese on top.  I top everything with something spicy.  their spicy habanero salsa adds the right amount of kick to it.

Also on my to have-again list from Huauchinango would be the mole (mo'lay).

I would easily give this play 5 stars if I could drink alcohol there and they don't  accept credit cards!!!  Oh Lord, please get the Square or something!  However, after I'm reminded how good the tamales are, I may come back for an update next week.  Stay tuned.

Oh Yeah... CASH ONLY.

Bottomless mimosas for 21 bucks inside the gorgeous Wynn hotel and an order of chicken and waffles that came with a spicy syrup made for quite a perfect brunch. 

The coffee was also delicious and they kept the pot full and hot.

Took my lil man in here for his first ever hair cut... As part of our tradition the first haircut meant getting his head shaved. He was obviously not thrilled about it and cried through the process, but the girls there were so nice. The lady cutting my sons hair was so sweet and gentle, and a co-worker tried to help keep him distracted with bubbles. As per my request they saved all his hair and also took pictures for us after. We went on a weekday evening, and didn't have to wait at all to be seen.
Overall, it was a great first time experience for us at a kids hair salon and when baby boy is ready for his next hair cut, we'll be back.

Based on my two visits to Nue, for two entirely different services, I'm definitely a fan. I was there over a year ago to get my nails done, and I remember it being a great experience. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere clean and bright. It is definitely much smaller than your conventional nail salons, and not the place you go with a group of girlfriends to get your nails done (It looked like there was a single nail tech). More recently though I was there for a waxing service. I was hesitant to try a new aesthetician but since my usual ( at a different spa) was traveling for a few weeks, I decided to give Nue a try. I was really impressed.. So much so that this may became my new usual. With prices comparable to other similar spas, and a convenient location, I look forward to my next visit there!

We've learned that restaurant.com comes in very handy for Vegas. We had a $25 certificate for this place and tried it out for brunch. The place was pretty empty when we arrived (I suppose 2pm is a bit late for brunch...), but the service was quite helpful and friendly. We settled on the ham/spinach/mushroom omelet (good) with toast and the huevos rancheros with house-made chorizo (SO good! At the top of the list of the best of had). To make our $50 target to use the certificate, we ordered their "mini" deserts. Aside from getting a cherry cobbler instead of the strawberry shortcake, the desserts where a nice, sweet, ending to a very satisfying brunch. Quick note: they close at 3pm and take the last lunch setting at 2:30pm - plan accordingly.

They also have awesome add-one and products available. The hydrofirm helps your tan last longer, and if you need to shower soon, they have a rapid tan that lets you shower within a couple of hours. The quality is amazing, and I'd recommend anyone I know to get their tans here.

As of June 2011 this car wash is under new ownership and is owned by the power house local car wash team of Francis and Sons. Do not consider any reviews prior to this date.

I'm a Realtor and owner of Myriad Real Estate Group, also on Yelp, and I have individuals in my car all the time. Due to this fact it is important to me to have a clean car. Even though this location is right across the street from my office I had dismissed them when it was Arizona Auto Wash. Once they were purchased by Francis and Sons I decided to give them another chance. The fact that they were giving out free washes at the time may have had something to do with that. With the new ownership they also have all new employees and they do a fantastic job. They've also updated and repaired their facilities so your car actually gets cleaned. They offer great deals online and the order taker often times will negotiate on price. If you haven't been in a while or are new to the area give these guys a chance, I'm sure you wont be disappointed.

Wildflower is a great unique place that serves up excellent breakfasts and lunches. Their portion sizes are large so come hungry or be prepared to take some home with you. They are so much, and I can't stress this enough, so much better than Paradise Bakery. They even have delicious baked goods. One of my favorite things to do is go on a bike ride with my girlfriend and stop there for lunch or a late breakfast, then go grocery shopping at Trader Joe's, which is right next door. They also have great coffee so go to them instead of a Starbucks, which I'm sure there is one around the corner. My favorite sandwich is the Chicken Pesto which I usually customize to suit my particular needs, my girlfriend says that I'm kind of a food snob.

This is the first location that U.S. Egg opened in the valley and now they have one in Scottsdale and plan on opening a 3rd in Chandler. It is a locally owned business by what I think are brothers. You can see them working at each of their locations from open to close. Their food is amazing and is perfect for lunch and breakfast. My business partner and I stopped in for lunch and to my pleasant surprise they have an entire menu dedicated to the Atkins and South Beach diets. I'm not officially on either of those diets but I do try to steer clear of carbs during lunch and dinner. This menu was built for me. I ended up ordering a grilled chicken breast with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and avocado. It was delicious and I was in heaven. I will definitely be frequenting U.S. Egg more often.

I always get wings with the desert heat rub. Surprisingly, it is awesome and I want to buy to take home. It's spicy, but not overpowering. It sticks to the meat well too.

I usually a sauce too, I like mango habanero which is spicy and could be too spicy for some, I like it and there is a sweet taste as well.

The potatoes wedges which are seasoned wedges with chives, you can add cheese and bacon.

This practice is made up of several orthopedic doctors. I see Dr. Bruns. I have been going to him for years for various things- and am always happy with the outcome. Last year I had 2 total knee replacements (I call them January and June)  and now I am a new woman. I have no pain and can walk without any problems and no limp. Rehab was tough but not compared to living with the pain I was in. At least I knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel. When I go to my appointments I have my questions on my notes app ready to ask and Dr. Bruns is always happy to answer all of the questions I ask him.

I must also compliment his assistant Julie. She is the best. She always explains everything you need to do or how to use anything you are given. I especially like that the practice has their emails on their websites so if I have a quick question, I can send her an email and not wait for an appointment. She will either get me the answer or let me know what to do.

Lastly, one of the other doctors in the practice had to have a knee replacement and he chose Dr. Bruns to do it. That says something.  

There are also 2 offices. One is on the NE corner of 56th Street and Bell and the other is on 7th Street, north of Thunderbird on the west side of the street. I put the same review for that office as well.

I think this is named Cambridge Cleaners now. And it is $2.50 an item. But...having been a dry cleaners daughter I am not impressed. At all. Yes.....you get what you pay for but they are not able to get a simple salad dressing spot out of my husband's polo shirts. It has not been washed or thrown in the dryer which sets stains. It is not laundered- it is supposedly pre- spotted and then dry cleaned. 5 of the 7 had to be returned. I know it can come out. I have taken the very same shirts to another cleaners and voila- not a problem. SO why can't they get it out? I do not recommend and I won't go back.

I visited the Aviary for the first time for one of the "Aviary at Night" events.  Once a month on a Thursday, the Aviary opens its doors from 5:00-9:00 for an over 21 event.  The down side to this event is that there are no scheduled feedings or shows.  The plus side is that you aren't swamped by kids, you can wander through certain areas with a glass of wine (the main hallway with the bald eagle and the penguin area) and you get to see birds at a time most people don't get to see them.
In addition to the no kids, the cafe has a nice menu of specials (pulled pork nachos, salmon grilled cheese, a fruit and cheese tray).  There is also a bar with beer, wine and mixed drinks.  It was a fun event and something I will likely return to in the future.  

The Aviary is divided into themed areas.  There was at least one volunteer in each area ready to answer questions you had about the various birds and bird calls.  

There is a tropical rain forest with an array of colorful (and talkative) birds.  It is a free flight area where you may need to watch your step and look out above.  Most of the birds will keep their distance.  One that seems to greet you and say "you'd better behave in MY house" is the Crowned Pigeon.  It has a beautiful blue color and peacock like tail.  There was a very distinct call, but I had no way of knowing which bird it was.  It would be nice if they had some sort of interactive display or listening station that had examples of the various bird's calls so you can know what you are listening to.  

The wetlands is another free flight area.  The most visible birds in this area are the flamingos.  I'm not sure what was going on that evening, but the flamingos were having some sort of fight (or very loud play).  It was interesting to watch and seemed to get all the other birds riled up.  It got quite loud!  Another interesting bird in this area was the brown pelican.  A lot of the other birds were interesting but unfortunately, not knowing a lot about birds, I couldn't identify them.

Grasslands has another free flight area with finches, doves and more.  They were quite vocal as well.  And colorful.  At the end of this exhibit were two lively parrots who chatted saying things like "hello" and "hi ya!" along with whistling.  It was fun watching them and waiting to see what they would say next.

Canary's Call, Eagle Hall and Penguin Point all feature birds that you watch through the glass.  The bald eagle was incredibly majestic.  Seemed like he was strutting his stuff saying "yes, I know I am impressive!"  And the penguins were quite fun to watch splashing and swimming around in their enclosure.

I had plenty to see, I just expected that the Aviary would be larger then it was with more to see.  I guess if you go during normal hours your visit can be expanded by one of the feedings or shows.  I also wish there was more signage or interactives to give visitors a better sense of what they were seeing (and hearing).  

Overall, I really enjoyed the Aviary and will have a return visit.

I have had two fantastic experiences on the Gateway Clipper Fleet.  

The first was for the Captain's Dinner Dance cruies on Valentine's Day.  When you make your reservation, make a request if you want to be seated in a specific area, especially if you want window seating or to be seated on the main floor.  

I wasn't sure what to expect other than standard banquet fare and some dance music.  The cruise exceeded my expectations.  They were very efficient on getting passengers on board even though they herd you into a line so they can take your picture as you board the ship.  You were able to board about an hour before departure and enjoy a la carte drinks and appetizers.  Skip the appetizers and eat something before you get on or just save room for dinner.  Drinks were on the expensive side but that is to be expected at this type of event.  There were several speciality drinks that come in a souvenier cup.  Your second drink will be cheaper because you won't be paying for the glass again.  

As the boat pulled away from the docks, we were treated to a brief narration about hilights in Pittsburgh's skyline.  It was informative enough to give you a taste of information but not so intrusive that it was annoying.  Despite a fully packed boat, tables were escorted to the buffet quickly and efficiently and the food supply was constantly replenished.  Despite my thoughts that it would be standard banquet food, everything was actually quite tasty.  When the buffets were removed, the dancing started.  There was a live "band" that had guitar, keyboards and a singer (backed up by tracks of music).  Their quality of playing wasn't the best, but I'm a music snob so I let it slide so I could kick back nad have a good time.  They played a variety of music ranging over the decades but seemed to mostly focus on disco.  I would have preferred there to be more slow cances considering it was Valentine's Day, but we had a great time dancing.  Before we knew it, the boat was pulling back in to Station Square and a fun night came to a close.

The second time I took the Gateway Clipper was for the shuttle to a Pirates game.  The service was efficient and drops you off right at PNC Park.  My only complaint is that we just missed getting on to one of hte smaller ships so we had to wait until the larger one was at capacity before they shuttled us to PNC which ended up making us late for the start of the game.  If you plan on taking the shuttle, make sure you give yourself enough time.

This tiny, family-owned & run Greek joint shouldn't be missed if you find yourself anywhere close to Stephanie & Warn Springs. The same family who owns The Fat Greek on the west side also owns this place. The Fat Greek has a larger dining room and includes a bakery counter (the family, as I understand, is actually mostly Armenian and whips up some pretty incredible Armenian baked goods). The Great Greek Grill is a smaller place without the included bakery, but it's clean and light (mirrors along one wall and windows along two other walls help it feel larger & brighter). Service here is always patient and with a smile; you can tell they really care about keeping loyal customers. I can vouch for the fact that their hummus, tzatziki, spanakopita, Greek salad, and chicken souvlaki all have great flavor. I don't like dolmades, so I can't really help you there, though I can tell you these are longer and skinnier than most I've seen/tried. Unlike most Greek joints, this one also offers avgolemono soup, which I enjoyed, but since I don't have too much experience with different incarnations of it yet, I'm not sure how it compares. I love their chicken so much that I haven't tried their actual gyro meat, but nothing I've had there yet has done me wrong.

(Note: Evidently there's a duplicate page out there for this place, listed under its full name, The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill. I'd posted this review under that listing first (there are 5 other people that reviewed under that one), and now I'm posting it here as well.)

The only thing good about this place is that they did a nice job painting my nails.

This place is really dirty... The walls need a good wipe down... They are just plain dirty. The mirrors are covered with dust and are nasty. God only knows how clean their pedicure bowls and mani/pedi equipment are. This place is super crammed too. I would have walked out upon arrival but I decided to risk it.

They want cash only unless it's the last resort... They will take your debit card.  

$25 for a gel manicure and I think it was $20 for a regular pedi.

Save your money and go somewhere clean!

I'm sure excellent meals have been served here, however, the day that I visited was definitely NOT one of them. My husband and I ordered Poutine as a starter and found it "okay". You could definitely tell the fries were of the generic food service variety, and the gravy tasted as if it came straight from the jar. My husband ordered the pork shank and mash and was definitely let down. There was far more inedible fat and connective sinews than actual meat. I ordered the "peppy" pizza which was okay but wound up picking most of the pepperoni off because it was filled with hard gristle! I really wanted to give them a decent review, and I'm sure that other locations in MTL are decent, however, this one just didn't hit the mark- at all.
